# Multi-source evidence integrity repair - 2026-08-20

- Ported the executable follow-up from community PR #1204 onto the protected
  maintainer lane, preserving contributor credit while keeping fork code out of
  the direct source-merge path.
- Made every claim classify cited evidence as supporting or contradicting, and
  made conflict state fail closed against that classification.
- Canonicalized URL identity for fragment, host-case, and default-port variants
  before duplicate-source checks, with focused offline regression coverage.

# Multi-source research ledger import - 2026-08-20

- Ported community PR #1200 from the Apache-2.0 SandBase source at immutable
  upstream commit `fc25b2ed4548b1bb91621661e82d07d4bbd285a1` because the fork could
  not merge executable Python under the repository's approval policy.
- Preserved the bounded, provider-optional research workflow and offline
  evidence ledger while pinning its licence reference and distinguishing it
  from post-run evidence auditing.
- Adapted the upstream validator tests into the repository suite and added an
  ISO-date check for time-sensitive search metadata. Generated registries and
  plugin mirrors remain owned by protected canonical synchronization.

# Stack artifact cross-audit - 2026-08-20

- Ported the maintainer-only portions of community PRs #1187 and #1188 into one
  coherent review path: `aas stack audit` for local CLI checks and paired
  stack/plan comparison in the browser-local Workbench.
- Kept both surfaces read-only. They compare manifest digests, catalog
  identities, target bindings, and exact selected skill sets without applying
  a stack or reading project files in the browser.
- Preserved the contributor's CLI and web regression coverage and kept all
  generated catalog state outside the source PR.

# YouTube transcript compatibility repair - 2026-08-20

- Ported the canonical-source portion of community PR #1194 while leaving both
  plugin mirrors to protected canonical synchronization.
- Updated the bundled extractor and documented examples for both the legacy
  class API and the current instance API in `youtube-transcript-api`, including
  URL parsing and UTF-8 console output.
- Added isolated regression coverage for common YouTube URL forms, invalid
  URLs, legacy transcript retrieval, and modern raw-data retrieval without
  making network requests.

# Community skill import - 2026-08-14

- Imported the Apache-2.0-licensed `using-lwc` skill from
  [JanYork/using-lwc](https://github.com/JanYork/using-lwc) at immutable upstream
  commit `7bd8052e6fa012786e50eee09f46df06b0cda1b8`.
- Preserved the complete 22-file bundle while adding catalog metadata, explicit
  triggers, limitations, critical-risk classification, consent gates for CLI
  and global-memory initialization, and source credit required by this
  repository.
- Kept the contribution source-only; generated registries and plugin mirrors
  remain owned by protected canonical synchronization.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-08-09

- Resolved the dangling `resources/implementation-playbook.md` instruction in
  `context-driven-development` by pointing readers to the complete workflow and
  validation material already bundled in the skill.
- Restored Markdown rendering for every reported TypeScript example in
  `conversation-memory` and `context-window-management` with balanced,
  language-labelled code fences.
- Made the intended Brazilian Portuguese operating language explicit and
  internally consistent in `context-agent` and `context-guardian`, while
  retaining the English discovery and limitations headings required by catalog
  validation.
- Corrected both context skills from `safe` to `critical` because their bundled
  commands write local state and can archive or remove old context artifacts;
  added exact approval, backup, path, and platform limitations without changing
  the bundled runtime scripts.
- Kept the repair source-only. Generated catalogs and plugin mirrors remain
  owned by the protected canonical synchronization lane.

# Secur0 coordinated remediation - 2026-07-30

- Re-evaluated all 35 Secur0 reports against current protected `main`: 22 were
  open and 13 already closed or duplicated; rejected scanner-only claims that
  do not bypass exact-head semantic review and recovered three valid closed
  findings covering CSV formula injection and npm release provenance.
- Added source fixes for protected npm publication, read-only Supabase RLS,
  authenticated Telegram webhooks, Loki permission/dashboard boundaries,
  private credential storage, catalog read integrity, path and temporary-file
  confinement, safe external links, Vercel exclusion handling, pinned 2slides
  downloads, and spreadsheet-safe CSV exports.
- Added focused regression contracts, ran the required skill/reference/docs and
  workflow gates, regenerated the complete catalog once as validation, and
  removed generated registries and plugin mirrors from this source-only branch.
- Production Supabase migration, report status/comments, public PR, and any
  release remain separate approval gates; no coordinated-disclosure material
  was published by this local remediation pass.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-30

- Changed only the Antigravity direct-install default: a bare Antigravity target
  now stops before cloning or writing unless exact skills, metadata filters, or
  the explicit `--all` override are supplied.
- Added copyable guidance for an MCP-enabled Codex or Claude agent to inspect the
  project, choose exact AAS skill IDs, and preview the resulting Antigravity
  install while preserving AAS MCP's read-only boundary.
- Added regression coverage proving the blocked path performs no clone or target
  mutation, explicit selections and `--all` continue, and non-Antigravity hosts
  retain their existing behavior.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-29

- Hardened the legacy full-catalog installer without breaking its historical
  default: it now displays the selected risk distribution and provides a
  read-only `audit --skills` mode that recursively reports sensitive behavior,
  symlinks, and binary payloads before installation.
- Added a documented trust and antivirus-response model that distinguishes a
  signature match in instruction text from evidence of execution while treating
  loaded skills as untrusted instructions with real agent-tool consequences.
- Replaced thread-identified moving-branch installs with inspect-first,
  full-commit-pinned workflows and removed blanket safety claims, hidden writes,
  destructive rollback advice, and a developer-specific absolute path.
- Enforced an exact authorized-use disclaimer and a per-action target, scope,
  command, effect, and confirmation gate across every offensive-risk skill.
- Revalidated all 15 exported Codex Security findings against current protected `main` instead of treating historical scanner anchors as current code.
- Removed BrowserAct's mutable provider-served guide from the supported operating path; the pinned local CLI help may describe syntax, while the checked-in skill remains the complete policy.
- Enforced full-SHA GitHub blob URLs for linked FindMate profiles on both Moltbook drafts and GitHub thread parsing, with regression coverage for mutable branches, foreign hosts, query strings, and traversal-shaped paths.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-28

- Added a fail-closed provenance exception ledger for maintainer-verified upstream repository renames. The initial Modellix entry records that `Modellix/modellix-skill` and `Modellix/modellix-plugin` resolve to GitHub repository ID `1150322983`; only the exact recorded transition is allowed, while unrelated provenance changes remain blocked.
- Traced a live Search Console `Pagina con reindirizzamento` report to the
  slashless `/plugins` URL, which GitHub Pages correctly redirects to the
  indexable `/plugins/` route.
- Normalized every runtime link to workbench, plugin, topic, and skill pages
  through the existing trailing-slash route helper so crawlers are no longer
  invited to request redirecting URL variants.
- Added focused web-app assertions for trailing-slash navigation targets; the
  sitemap, canonical metadata, and public route remain aligned on `/plugins/`.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-26

- Imported the MIT-licensed `fedora-hyprland-installer` contribution from
  [maleksaadi0109/hyprfedora](https://github.com/maleksaadi0109/hyprfedora) at
  upstream commit `3ec6d4fc5eecdb188613dd841dce9926ae5c8319`.
- Hardened its privileged Fedora workflow with explicit critical-risk metadata,
  provenance, limitations, consistent NVIDIA guidance, isolated tests, and
  claims bounded to the behavior implemented by the bundled scripts.
- Added the MIT-licensed `find-complementary-founders` skill from
  [merc1305/findMate](https://github.com/merc1305/findMate).
- Preserved its own-owner-only invariant, offline evidence assessment,
  hash-bound publication approvals, expiring profiles, and stop-at-101 star
  rule while adapting metadata, triggers, provenance, and limitations to the
  AAS quality contract.
- Included the complete source skill directory without generated registry
  artifacts, private owner data, credentials, or publication receipts.
- Synced the five actionable review fixes from canonical FindMate release
  `v1.3.4`: consent-free private drafts, temporal consent validation,
  one-sided seeking cards, source-identity self-exclusion, and the bundled
  Russian onboarding reference. The canonical suite passes 40 tests and the
  portable release resolves to commit `c78a78b0280f4168294b72f38aa39317e7b7d7b8`.
- Synced the privacy-preserving G35 publication path from immutable canonical
  release `v1.3.5` at
  `d23cd66d0ee324c0ed7e85156606d8814250c1f8`: one exact owner-approved GitHub
  comment may now carry bounded inline JSON, the existing immutable linked
  source remains supported, and deleting or unmarking the source removes its
  current validation receipt. The owner is warned that the publishing login
  and proof/contact links may connect the alias to a real identity and that
  public edit history or copies prevent any promise of complete erasure.
- Preserved the AAS catalog metadata, usage guidance, provenance, limitations,
  source-only contract, and all owner consent boundaries while updating the
  five compatible reference/script files. The canonical FindMate suite passes
  47 tests; no owner profile, credential, generated registry, or plugin mirror
  is included in this contributor update.
- Added the MIT-licensed `orchestrate` skill from
  [provencher/codex-skills](https://github.com/provencher/codex-skills) at
  upstream commit `8aa6c42b73781c905c55f8a1253a18127079ac21`.
- Preserved its concise Codex-native delegation policy and UI metadata while
  adding the repository-required usage guidance, limitations, immutable
  provenance, and user-held approval boundaries.
- Kept the source PR limited to canonical skill content, source credit, and this
  maintenance evidence; generated registries and plugin mirrors remain owned by
  protected canonical synchronization.
- Consolidated the two open UIZZE contribution paths into one protected maintainer repair, preserving the actionable public-catalog research, design-contract, implementation, and hard finish-gate workflow contributed by [@samuelbushi](https://github.com/samuelbushi) in PR `#929` together with the bounded preview introduced by PR `#983`.
- Kept the free `check_ui_slop` preview optional while requiring explicit approval before persistent MCP configuration or external HTML/CSS transmission.
- Added the official MIT license metadata and organizational author while preserving the existing immutable source identity; GitHub redirects the historical upstream URL to the transferred official repository.
- Left generated registries and plugin mirrors out of the source PR so the protected canonical synchronization workflow remains their sole owner.
- Merged the consolidated source through PR [#985](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/pull/985), then converged generated state and plugin mirrors through protected PR [#986](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/pull/986).

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-04-17

- Imported 8 frontend/design skills from [Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill) into `skills/`:
  - `design-taste-frontend`
  - `gpt-taste`
  - `redesign-existing-projects`
  - `high-end-visual-design`
  - `minimalist-ui`
  - `industrial-brutalist-ui`
  - `stitch-design-taste`
  - `full-output-enforcement`
- Normalized the imported skill metadata to repository conventions:
  - folder names match `name`
  - `risk`, `source`, `source_repo`, `source_type`, `author`, and `date_added` are present
  - descriptions are shortened for validation
  - `## When to Use` sections were added where the upstream files did not have one
- Preserved the upstream `stitch-design-taste/DESIGN.md` artifact.
- Added source attribution for `Leonxlnx/taste-skill` in `README.md` and `docs/sources/sources.md`.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-04-05

- Merged community PR batch `#487`, `#488`, `#489`, and `#490` on GitHub with squash, following the maintainer GitHub-only merge contract instead of local integration.
- Used the repository batch shortcut for the initial pass, then switched to the manual maintainer playbook when fork metadata drift produced stale `pr-policy` failures on reopened PRs.
- Repaired PR `#488` on the contributor branch by adding the missing `fruitwyatt/puzzle-activity-planner` source credit to `README.md`, then pushed the maintainer fix back to the fork and re-ran the fork workflows.
- Normalized PR `#490` by patching the body to include the required `## Quality Bar Checklist ✅` section, then closed and reopened it to force fresh `pull_request` checks against the updated metadata.
- Approved the pending fork workflow runs for PRs `#487` through `#490` after each reopen/push cycle so `Skills Registry CI`, `Skill Review & Optimize`, `Dependency Review`, and `CodeQL` could execute on the contributor heads.
- Ran the mandatory post-merge `npm run sync:contributors` follow-up after each successful merge and pushed the resulting README contributor-sync commits directly to `main` when the sync changed tracked files.
- Prepared the `v9.12.0` release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` to cover the Rayden UI additions, puzzle activity planning, skill diagnostics, and the `sales-automator` YAML repair before starting the release workflow.

- Closed issues `#455` and `#456` with maintainer comments explaining what a follow-up submission must include before reopening:
  - concrete repo diff or implementation PR
  - source-only contributor branch
  - Quality Bar checklist and maintainer validations from `.github/MAINTENANCE.md`
- Reviewed open issues `#455` and `#456` during the maintainer sweep; neither had a matching accepted PR and both remain open pending a source-quality contributor submission.
- Triaged PR `#454` as superseded by `#457` because `#457` rebuilds the Windows validation/test fixes on top of current `main` and includes the follow-up batch activation fix requested in review.
- Verified PR `#457` locally on the contributor head with:
  - `npm run validate`
  - `npm run validate:references`
  - `npm run check:warning-budget`
  - `npm run check:readme-credits -- --base origin/main --head HEAD`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run app:test:coverage`
  - `npm run app:build`
- Cleaned PR `#457` back to the repository's source-only PR contract by dropping maintainer-owned generated registry artifacts before merge review.
- Normalized the PR metadata so the required Quality Bar Checklist is present before re-triggering the fork-based GitHub Actions checks.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-30

- Merged PR #418 on GitHub with squash after approving the pending fork workflow run and waiting for `pr-policy`, `source-validation`, and `artifact-preview` to finish green.
- Repaired PR #423's stale metadata state by updating the PR body to include the required Quality Bar Checklist, then closed and reopened it to force fresh `pull_request` runs before squash merging it on GitHub.
- Synced local `main` after the PR merge batch so release preparation starts from the canonical remote state.
- Resolved issue #421 by ensuring the `README.md` Community Contributed Skills section includes `SoulPass` on `main`.
- Resolved issue #419 by tightening the `github-issue-creator` frontmatter description and "When to Use" guidance for better discoverability.
- Prepared the `v9.3.0` release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` and recorded the maintainer actions here before running the release flow.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-29

- Re-triaged the full 2026-03-15 security finding set against current `main` and wrote a fresh current-head report in `docs/maintainers/security-findings-triage-2026-03-29-refresh.md`.
- Added a matching machine-readable export at `docs/maintainers/security-findings-triage-2026-03-29-refresh.csv` so the refreshed statuses are available in both markdown and CSV form.
- Kept the old `2026-03-15` markdown/CSV as historical baseline input, preserved the smaller `2026-03-29` addendum as a transition note, and pointed both docs at the new refresh as the current source of truth.
- The refreshed triage currently lands at:
  - `0` findings still present and exploitable
  - `0` findings still present but low practical risk
  - `26` obsolete/not reproducible on current HEAD
  - `7` duplicates
- The refresh folds in the hardening shipped today and earlier in the session:
  - symlink/path safety in maintainer/install/web copy flows
  - frontmatter parser robustness
  - removal of shared frontend star writes
  - secure Office unpack behavior
  - migration away from predictable `/tmp` state files

- Fixed the remaining production/documentation drift introduced by the web-app and CI hardening work:
  - clarified that the hosted GitHub Pages app runs in static public-catalog mode
  - documented that `Sync Skills` is development-only unless explicitly enabled in local maintainer runs
  - documented that web-app save/star interactions are intentionally browser-local today
- Hardened the maintainer documentation so release and CI expectations now match the live workflows:
  - release docs now mention the shared `tools/requirements.txt` install path, the web-app coverage gate, and blocking `npm audit --audit-level=high` on publish
  - maintainer docs now document the narrow canonical-artifact auto-sync contract on `main`
- Expanded the documented risk-maintenance workflow after the new automation landed:
  - `audit:skills` exposes `suggested_risk`
  - `sync:risk-labels` supports conservative high-confidence legacy cleanup
  - offensive auto-promotions now also insert the canonical `AUTHORIZED USE ONLY` notice
- Updated user-facing install docs to mention that the npm installer now uses a shallow clone for lighter first-run installs.
- Updated the onboarding/trust docs to reflect the real `risk` taxonomy (`unknown`, `none`, `safe`, `critical`, `offensive`) instead of the older simplified wording.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-25

- Imported 14 skills from [Dimillian/Skills](https://github.com/Dimillian/Skills) into `skills/`:
  - `app-store-changelog`
  - `github`
  - `ios-debugger-agent`
  - `macos-menubar-tuist-app`
  - `macos-spm-app-packaging`
  - `orchestrate-batch-refactor`
  - `project-skill-audit`
  - `react-component-performance`
  - `simplify-code`
  - `swift-concurrency-expert`
  - `swiftui-liquid-glass`
  - `swiftui-performance-audit`
  - `swiftui-ui-patterns`
  - `swiftui-view-refactor`
- Normalized the imported skill metadata to match repository validation requirements:
  - shortened oversized frontmatter descriptions
  - added `risk`, `source`, and `date_added`
  - added `## When to Use` sections so the imported batch does not increase the warning budget
- Added source attribution for `Dimillian/Skills` in:
  - `README.md` under `Credits & Sources`
  - `docs/sources/sources.md`
- Merged PR `#395` via GitHub squash merge after maintainer refresh of forked workflow approvals and PR body normalization; this added the new `snowflake-development` skill.
- Merged PR `#394` via GitHub squash merge after converting the contributor branch back to source-only, normalizing the PR checklist body, and shortening an oversized `wordpress-penetration-testing` description so CI passed.
- Patched `skills/snowflake-development/SKILL.md` on `main` with a `## When to Use` section so the repository stayed within the frozen validation warning budget after the PR merge batch.
- Reworked `/apply-optimize` automation to address GitHub code scanning alert `#36`: the public `issue_comment` trigger now only queues a trusted workflow, while the privileged branch checkout/apply logic runs in a separate `workflow_dispatch` path limited to same-repository branches.
- Ran the required direct-`main` maintainer sync flow after touching `skills/`:
  - `npm run chain`
  - `npm run check:warning-budget`
  - `npm run catalog`
- Synced maintainer-owned generated artifacts and metadata to the new `1,325+` skill count:
  - `README.md`
  - `package.json`
  - `skills_index.json`
  - `CATALOG.md`
  - `data/catalog.json`
  - `data/bundles.json`
  - curated user/maintainer docs updated by `sync_repo_metadata.py`

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-21 Follow-up Import Sync

- Imported and normalized a new batch of external skills into `skills/`, covering Anthropic Claude API/internal comms entries, marketing workflows, SEO orchestration/sub-skills, and Obsidian-focused file-format/CLI skills.
- Added and standardized the following imported skill families:
  - `claude-api`, `internal-comms`
  - `ad-creative`, `ai-seo`, `churn-prevention`, `cold-email`, `content-strategy`, `lead-magnets`, `product-marketing-context`, `revops`, `sales-enablement`, `site-architecture`
  - `seo`, `seo-competitor-pages`, `seo-content`, `seo-dataforseo`, `seo-geo`, `seo-hreflang`, `seo-image-gen`, `seo-images`, `seo-page`, `seo-plan`, `seo-programmatic`, `seo-schema`, `seo-sitemap`, `seo-technical`
  - `defuddle`, `json-canvas`, `obsidian-bases`, `obsidian-cli`, `obsidian-markdown`
- Preserved the existing `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, and `xlsx` aliases as the repository's symlinked `*-official` entries instead of duplicating those directories.
- Normalized imported frontmatter so the new skills align with repository validation expectations:
  - shortened oversized descriptions
  - added missing `risk`, `source`, and `date_added` fields where needed
  - added `## When to Use` sections across the new imports
  - removed or rewrote imported dangling links that referenced non-existent upstream paths in this repository
- Added maintainer provenance notes in `docs/maintainers/skills-import-2026-03-21.md` so the source repository for each imported skill group is documented for future maintenance.
- Regenerated maintainer-owned derived artifacts after the import:
  - `README.md`
  - `skills_index.json`
  - `CATALOG.md`
  - `data/catalog.json`
  - `data/bundles.json`
- Verified the direct-`main` maintenance flow with:
  - `npm run validate`
  - `npm run index`
  - `npm run catalog`
  - `npm run chain`

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-18

- Fixed issue `#344` by correcting `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the marketplace plugin entry uses `source: "./"` instead of `"."`, matching Claude Code's relative-path schema requirement for marketplace entries.
- Added `tools/scripts/tests/claude_plugin_marketplace.test.js` and wired it into the local test suite so invalid marketplace `source` paths fail fast in CI/maintainer verification.
- Merged PRs `#333`, `#336`, `#338`, `#343`, `#340`, `#334`, and `#345` via GitHub squash merge after maintainer refresh of forked workflows and PR metadata.
- Closed PR `#337` and PR `#342` as superseded by `#338`, then closed issue `#339` manually after confirming the accepted fix path; issue `#335` auto-closed from the merged PR body.
- Closed issue `#344` with a follow-up comment after shipping the plugin marketplace fix on `main`, and left PR `#341` open with a blocking review comment because the submitted skill content is corrupted even though CI is green.
- Documented a new maintainer edge case in `.github/MAINTENANCE.md`: forked runs in `action_required`, `pr-policy` failures caused by stale PR bodies, the REST API fallback when `gh pr edit` fails with the Projects Classic GraphQL error, and the need to `close`/`reopen` a PR when a plain rerun does not pick up updated metadata.
- Refreshed the release-facing docs for `8.2.0` across `README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, `docs/users/walkthrough.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Published release `v8.2.0` on `main` with:
  - `npm run release:preflight`
  - `npm run security:docs`
  - `npm run release:prepare -- 8.2.0`
  - `npm run release:publish -- 8.2.0`

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-17

- Synced `main` after the six merged community PRs and re-verified all forked PR workflows through GitHub before final release prep.
- Reopened/approved forked GitHub Actions runs where needed, normalized missing PR quality checklists, and merged PRs `#331`, `#330`, `#326`, `#324`, `#325`, and `#329` with GitHub squash merge.
- Patched `skills/vibers-code-review/SKILL.md` on the contributor branch for PR `#325` so the skill had valid YAML frontmatter, a `When to Use` section, and explicit limitations; reran CI and merged after green checks.
- Closed issue `#327` with a release comment pointing to `#331`, and closed issue `#328` as a duplicate of `#269` with links to the README recovery guidance and `docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md`.
- Updated release-facing docs before cutting `v8.1.0`:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/users/getting-started.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `walkthrough.md`
- Refreshed the README contributor acknowledgements to include the latest merged contributors from the maintenance batch.
- Release workflow to run for `8.1.0`:
  - `npm run release:preflight`
  - `npm run security:docs`
  - `npm run release:prepare -- 8.1.0`
  - `npm run release:publish -- 8.1.0`

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-12

- Merged PRs `#277`, `#272`, `#275`, `#278`, and `#271` via GitHub squash merge after bringing contributor branches into a mergeable state and refreshing PR bodies against the quality checklist in `.github/MAINTENANCE.md`.
- Verified PR `#271` locally with `npm run validate:references` and `npm run test` before merge; confirmed `#269` auto-closed from the merged PR body.
- Added a user-facing Windows truncation recovery guide at `docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md`, linked it from `README.md`, `docs/users/faq.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, and `docs/integrations/jetski-cortex.md`, and credited the workflow to issue `#274`.
- Updated `skills/metasploit-framework/SKILL.md` to remove the remote installer flow, require an existing Metasploit installation, and add the required offensive-skill warning.
- Refreshed `README.md` to remove stale `7.2.0` / `7.4.0` onboarding copy, align the star badge with the current milestone, and fix the TOC link for `## Contributing`.
- Normalized the active English docs (`README.md`, user guides, Kiro guide, and evergreen maintainer docs) to the current `7.6.0` / `1,250+ skills` state and removed emoji from H2 headers where maintenance rules require clean anchors.
- Ran the required maintenance validations after the direct fixes:
  - `npm run validate`
  - `npm run validate:references`
  - `npm run chain`
  - `npm run catalog`
- Final release prep, issue closure comments, and verification were completed on `main`.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-13

- Fixed `tools/scripts/update_readme.py` so normal `npm run readme` runs preserve the existing `registry-sync` star/timestamp values instead of rewriting them on every execution, which was causing non-deterministic PR drift failures in CI.
- Updated `tools/scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py` to expose the same explicit `--refresh-volatile` behavior for live star/timestamp refreshes, keeping release/metadata refresh flows available without destabilizing contributor PR checks.
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so generated registry drift is informational on pull requests but still strict on `main`, with auto-sync remaining the canonical path for shared artifacts after merge.
- Updated `.github/MAINTENANCE.md`, `docs/maintainers/ci-drift-fix.md`, and `docs/maintainers/merging-prs.md` to document the lower-friction merge flow: validate source changes on PRs, keep `main` for generated conflicts, and let `main` auto-sync the final artifact set.
- Verified the fix with:
  - `python3 tools/scripts/update_readme.py --dry-run`
  - `python3 tools/scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py --dry-run`
  - `npm run readme`
  - `npm run validate:references`
- Added `tools/config/generated-files.json` as the single contract for derived registry artifacts so CI, maintainer scripts, and docs share the same file list.
- Added scripted workflow entrypoints: `npm run pr:preflight`, `npm run release:preflight`, `npm run release:prepare -- X.Y.Z`, and `npm run release:publish -- X.Y.Z`.
- Split PR CI into `pr-policy`, `source-validation`, and `artifact-preview` so PRs stay source-only, policy failures are explicit, and generated drift is previewed separately from source validation.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` so contributors are told not to commit derived files and to enable `Allow edits from maintainers`.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-14

- Added root Claude Code plugin marketplace support via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, exposing the repository as a single plugin entry that points at the existing `skills/` tree.
- Updated the user onboarding trinity (`README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, `docs/users/faq.md`) so Claude Code users can install via `/plugin marketplace add sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` in addition to the existing `npx` installer flow.
- Merged PRs `#302`, `#301`, `#299`, `#297`, `#296`, `#287`, `#298`, and `#293` via GitHub squash merge after maintainer preflight, including a maintained follow-up commit on the contributor branch for `#298` and a maintainer conflict-resolution refresh on `#293`.
- Verified the issue-driven fixes locally before merge:
  - `#301`: `python3 -m py_compile skills/notebooklm/scripts/browser_utils.py`
  - `#299`: `node -c tools/bin/install.js`
- Verified the skill/docs PRs locally before merge:
  - `#297`, `#296`, `#287`, `#298`: `npm run validate`
  - `#293`, `#298`: `npm run validate:references`
- Closed issues `#288`, `#300`, `#286`, and `#281` from the merged fixes and release notes flow; documented `#294` as a release follow-up because the support already exists in the current catalog.
- Removed stale Windows `core.symlinks=true` / Developer Mode guidance from the user docs after the `#299` installer fix, keeping the Windows path on the standard clone/install flow.
- Ran the post-merge maintainer sync on `main`:
  - `npm run chain`
  - `npm run catalog`
- Refreshed `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, `docs/users/faq.md`, and the contributor acknowledgements to prepare the single `7.8.0` release cut.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-03-21 Initial Import Batch

- Imported the missing external skill coverage identified from `travisvn/awesome-claude-skills`, `anthropics/skills`, `coreyhaines31/marketingskills`, `AgriciDaniel/claude-seo`, and `kepano/obsidian-skills`, bringing the indexed registry to `1,304` skills on `main`.
- Added maintainer attribution notes in `docs/maintainers/skills-import-2026-03-21.md` and refreshed the generated registry artifacts after the import batch.
- Re-aligned the public documentation surface to the current repository state:
  - `README.md`
  - `package.json`
  - `docs/users/getting-started.md`
  - `docs/users/usage.md`
  - `docs/users/claude-code-skills.md`
  - `docs/users/gemini-cli-skills.md`
  - `docs/users/visual-guide.md`
  - `docs/users/bundles.md`
  - `docs/users/kiro-integration.md`
  - `docs/integrations/jetski-cortex.md`
  - `docs/maintainers/repo-growth-seo.md`
  - `docs/maintainers/skills-update-guide.md`
- Updated the changelog `Unreleased` section so the post-`v8.4.0` main branch state documents both the imported skill families and the docs/About realignment.
- Automated the recurring docs metadata maintenance by extending `tools/scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py`, wiring it into `npm run chain`, and adding a regression test so future skill-count/version updates propagate through the curated docs surface without manual patching.
- Added a remote GitHub About sync path (`npm run sync:github-about`) backed by `gh repo edit` + `gh api .../topics` so the public repository metadata can be refreshed from the same source of truth on demand.
- Added maintainer automation for repo-state hygiene: `sync:contributors` updates the README contributor list from GitHub contributors, `check:stale-claims`/`audit:consistency` catch drift in count-sensitive docs, and `sync:repo-state` now chains the local maintainer sweep into a single command.
- Hardened automation surfaces beyond the local CLI: `main` CI now runs the unified repo-state sync, tracked web artifacts are refreshed through `sync:web-assets`, release verification now uses a deterministic `sync:release-state` path plus `npm pack --dry-run`, the npm publish workflow reruns those checks before publishing, and a weekly `Repo Hygiene` GitHub Actions workflow now sweeps slow drift on `main`.
- Added two maintainer niceties on top of the hardening work: `check:warning-budget` freezes the accepted `135` validation warnings so they cannot silently grow, and `audit:maintainer` prints a read-only health snapshot of warning budget, consistency drift, and git cleanliness.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-16 Android Overheating Diagnostics

- Audited the cached third-party `adb-performance` skill and rejected a direct import because its linked source repository is unavailable, its license cannot be verified, and it mixes weak snapshot heuristics with unguarded device mutations.
- Added the clean-room canonical `diagnose-android-overheating` skill, grounded in current Android and AOSP documentation.
- Replaced generic “optimization” commands with a read-only-first evidence workflow, controlled comparisons, OEM-aware interpretation, confidence labels, privacy handling, explicit approval gates, rollback requirements, and a hardware-safety stop.
- Added `references/evidence-and-interpretation.md` for symptom-specific ADB evidence, thermal status interpretation, correlation rules, Batterystats capture discipline, and bugreport privacy.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-16 Tessl Workspace Repair

- Corrected the Skill Review workflow and trusted review helper to use the token-visible `antigravity-awesome-skills` Tessl workspace instead of the renamed repository slug.
- Added a repository-variable override so future Tessl workspace migrations can be handled through `TESSL_WORKSPACE` without another workflow patch.
- Updated the review command regression test to lock the corrected workspace argument.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-16 Tessl Credit Guard

- Added a deterministic fingerprint over the changed `SKILL.md` content and active review policy.
- Reuse a previously successful review for identical content, avoiding Tessl setup and another charged review after unrelated PR pushes or base refreshes.
- Route an explicit Tessl credit/quota failure to `manual-review-required` with exact-head attestation; unrelated Tessl failures still fail closed.
- Added regression coverage for fingerprint invalidation, GitHub Actions cache wiring, quota classification, and truthful review outcomes.
# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-17 Legacy Redirect Infrastructure

- Preserved the Google Search Console HTML verification file on the legacy Pages path and the Bing Webmaster Tools meta token on the legacy root redirect.
- Made redirect generation follow the current `skills_index.json` count while retaining the curated sitemap-count lock and exact route-set validation.
- Added `pages:redirect-verify` for byte-exact managed-tree validation plus bounded or full live route probing.
- Versioned the redirect manifest contract as schema `3`, including webmaster-verification evidence consumed by the protected sync.
- Added explicit source-repository provenance to the live manifest and used that change to exercise the complete protected auto-sync cycle.
- Documented the protected cross-repository synchronization contract for `sickn33/sickn33.github.io`.
- Added regression coverage for webmaster tokens, reserved-path collisions, dynamic skill counts, local drift, stale files, and live manifest/route verification.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-07-22 Security Findings and Windows Preview

- Remediated the live dependency advisories for `fast-uri`, `brace-expansion`, and `body-parser` in their affected lockfiles.
- Hardened AAS Core cache ancestry, transaction durability, bounded MCP manifest state, exact-search behavior, redirect-tree reads, release-PR selection, and maintainer merge authorization.
- Expanded skill-review fingerprints and workflow triggers to cover bundled support files, and tightened unsafe guidance in the affected canonical skills.
- Fixed native Windows ACL inspection for AAS preview by making PowerShell path handling explicit and returning bounded phase/path diagnostics for unresolved ACL identities.
- Added regression coverage for every confirmed code-path finding and documented the Windows 10/11 Codex CLI preview contract from discussion `#956`.

# Maintenance Walkthrough - 2026-08-06 Agent Plugins 1.0 Portability

- Added a standard root `plugin.json` to every editorial bundle that passes the existing Codex/Claude safety gates and the Agent Plugins immediate-child skill-layout rule.
- Kept the host-specific full-library roots separate, flattened qualified paths only inside generated packages, and normalized AAS provenance/risk fields into standard string metadata without changing instruction bodies.
- Pinned offline validation to an attributed snapshot of the official Agent Plugins 1.0.0 JSON Schema, added deterministic Codex prompt fallbacks, and covered closed-schema, fixed-discovery, pilot-bundle, and release-alignment regressions.
- Updated the user onboarding trinity, plugin/bundle guides, maintainer contract, and release checklist while leaving the active release-notes PR untouched.
