## [Unreleased]

## [15.12.0] - 2026-08-09 - "Catalog Discovery and Safer Context Skills"

> Upgraded the public catalog into a practical discovery dashboard, added two focused research and planning skills, and repaired unsafe or malformed context-management guidance.

This release gives Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants a more usable 2,007-skill catalog. Users can now share precise catalog searches, keep a browser-local shortlist, inspect related skills, and start from clearer catalog-health signals while the underlying skill library gains bounded people research, source-aware travel planning, and stronger warnings around destructive context-agent workflows.

Start here:

- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Added

- Added [`people-data`](skills/people-data/) for authorized LinkedIn professional-profile and public business-contact research plus YouTube channel business-email discovery through the Agent Body MCP server, with an exact bundled tool contract and read-only boundaries.
- Added [`travel-planner`](skills/travel-planner/) for budget-first itinerary planning with destination constraints, dated factual sources, explicit alternatives for out-of-scope routes, and a rule self-check table in every plan.
- Added shareable fuzzy search and filters, keyboard-focused discovery, a browser-local shortlist with cross-tab synchronization and exact-ID export, catalog-health signals, and related-skill discovery to the hosted catalog.

### Changed

- Updated [`unified-ai-gateway`](skills/unified-ai-gateway/) to distinguish the current public `v0.4.3` release from the immutable `v0.4.0` security-review baseline without changing its reviewed activation or inspection boundaries.
- Updated `react-virtuoso` to 4.18.11 in the web app and `express-rate-limit` to 8.6.0 in the bundled Loki example.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog, offline AAS Core data, marketplaces, bundles, Agent Plugins exports, and Codex/Claude plugin distributions for 2,007 skills.

### Security

- Corrected `context-agent` and `context-guardian` to `risk: critical`, translated remaining guidance, and made their destructive local-write behavior and prerequisites explicit.
- Repaired malformed executable TypeScript examples in `conversation-memory` and `context-window-management`, and removed a dangling playbook reference from `context-driven-development`.
- Made catalog shortlist reads fail safely when browser storage is unavailable or throws, while keeping shortlist data local to the browser.

### Who should care

- Users who need to search, compare, shortlist, and share exact catalog views instead of browsing more than two thousand skills manually.
- Researchers using public professional or business-contact data who need explicit authorization, read-only scope, and an exact MCP tool contract.
- Travelers who want budget-confirmed, source-aware itineraries with visible constraint checks.
- Maintainers and agents relying on context-management skills where destructive filesystem behavior must be unmistakable.

### Validation

- Passed all 109 repository test groups, 173 web-app tests, web-app lint and production build, repository validation, reference validation, documentation security checks, warning-budget enforcement, and exact-head PR evidence gates.
- Confirmed root and web-app dependency audits report zero vulnerabilities, protected `main` CI and CodeQL are green, and canonical regeneration is idempotent.
- Verified web-app coverage at 85.04% statements, 72.95% branches, 86.37% functions, and 89.17% lines.

## [15.11.0] - 2026-08-07 - "Agent Plugin Directory Readiness"

> Prepared the flagship AAS Agent & MCP Builder for the OpenAI Plugins Directory with production metadata, public policies, and a reproducible evaluation dossier.

This release turns the portable Agent Plugins work from 15.10.0 into a directory-ready product surface. The flagship bundle now carries the listing metadata and assets needed by compatible clients, while the repository records the exact claims, prompts, test cases, execution evidence, and publisher-only approval boundaries required for a truthful public submission.

Start here:

- Flagship plugin: [`AAS Agent & MCP Builder`](plugins/agentic-bundle-aas-agent-mcp-builder/)
- Submission dossier: [`docs/plugin-submissions/aas-agent-mcp-builder/`](docs/plugin-submissions/aas-agent-mcp-builder/)
- Plugin guide: [`docs/users/plugins.md`](docs/users/plugins.md)
- Privacy: [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md)
- Terms: [`TERMS.md`](TERMS.md)

### Added

- Added a version-controlled OpenAI Plugins Directory submission dossier for `AAS Agent & MCP Builder`, including public listing copy, starter prompts, six positive and four negative evaluation cases, a recorded 10/10 Codex execution pass, release notes, and explicit publisher-owned approval boundaries.
- Added project privacy and terms documents covering skills-only plugins, the browser-local catalog and Workbench behavior, third-party services, and support channels.

### Changed

- Enriched generated Codex plugin manifests with public website, privacy, and terms metadata, and added production logo assets to the flagship Agent & MCP Builder package.

### Who should care

- Agent builders who want an installable, curated path through AAS architecture, MCP, RAG, LangGraph, evaluation, and context-management skills.
- Compatible agent clients that surface plugin identity, artwork, website, privacy, and terms metadata.
- Maintainers who need a reviewable boundary between repository evidence and publisher-only OpenAI platform attestations.

### Validation

- Executed all ten dossier cases in fresh, read-only Codex sessions: six expected activations and four expected non-activations, with 10/10 passing.
- Validated the dossier against the generated flagship manifest, required listing fields, asset paths, starter prompts, case coverage, and recorded execution results.
- Passed repository skill validation, reference validation, documentation security checks, warning-budget enforcement, bundle checks, plugin compatibility checks, Agent Plugin schema tests, and the Codex plugin validator across all 58 packages.

## [15.10.0] - 2026-08-07 - "Portable Agent Plugins and Governed Workflows"

> Added portable Agent Plugins 1.0 exports, a video-production router, consent-gated outreach, and stronger trust boundaries across the catalog.

This release gives Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants a safer, more portable 2,005-skill catalog. It packages 58 eligible editorial bundles in the shared Agent Plugins format alongside the existing Codex and Claude distributions, adds reply-aware outreach with explicit approval before real sends, introduces an upstream-pinned video routing guide, and hardens web scraping against hostile page content.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Added

- Added [`outreachagent`](skills/outreachagent/) for inbox, contact, template, workflow, webhook, and delivery-metric operations through OutreachAgent's public REST API, with separate draft and final-send approvals, exact rendered-payload review, reply-aware exits, and untrusted-inbound handling.
- Added [`video-router`](skills/video-router/) from the official OrkasVideoStudio source for locking generation, deterministic composition, supplied-footage editing, or an automatic cross-modal production plan before execution, with explicit runtime and produced-vs-planned boundaries.

### Changed

- Added Agent Plugins 1.0 as a portable packaging target for eligible editorial bundles, with schema-pinned root manifests, collision-safe flattened skill IDs, Agent Skills-compatible packaged frontmatter, and preserved AAS provenance and risk metadata. Broad host-specific roots remain on their existing Codex and Claude surfaces rather than making a false portability claim.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog, offline AAS Core data, marketplaces, bundles, Agent Plugins exports, and Codex/Claude plugin distributions for 2,005 skills.

### Security

- Hardened [`web-scraper`](skills/web-scraper/) against prompt injection from page content, constrained downloads to an exact user-confirmed output path, required consent before browser escalation, and clarified stop conditions for authenticated or sensitive pages.
- Hardened coordinated-disclosure trust boundaries across NotebookLM, YouTube ingestion, Instagram OAuth and CSV export, Telegram HTML replies, Loki task export, Vercel claim verification, macOS packaging templates, and generated TSX content.
- Added focused regression coverage for path containment, private temporary storage, inert rendering, OAuth callback binding, data-only version parsing, and untrusted browser or model output.

### Who should care

- Agent clients and plugin authors adopting the shared Agent Plugins format across compatible hosts.
- Video teams that need an explicit, reviewable decision between generation, composition, editing, and a cross-modal production plan before execution.
- Teams building AI-assisted outbound workflows that need explicit recipient, sender, payload, schedule, and real-send approval boundaries.
- Agents extracting public web content where hostile page instructions must remain untrusted data.
- Security-conscious users relying on NotebookLM, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, Loki, Vercel, or macOS packaging skills.
- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity users installing from canonical or plugin distributions.

### Validation

- Passed canonical skill and reference validation, documentation security, warning-budget enforcement, changed-skill evidence, the complete repository suite, web-app coverage, package dry-run checks, and dependency audits.
- Validated every generated portable manifest against the pinned official Agent Plugins 1.0 schema, every eligible package with the Codex plugin validator, and each packaged skill instance against the Agent Skills reference validator.
- Confirmed protected `main` CI and CodeQL are green and canonical regeneration is idempotent before release preparation.

- Added [`shopify-review-triage`](skills/shopify-review-triage/) for turning supplied public Shopify App Store reviews into a source-linked P0-P3 first-pass brief, with private-data stop conditions, human-verification labels, and no outbound messaging.

### Changed

- Updated [`unified-ai-gateway`](skills/unified-ai-gateway/) to the reviewed v0.4.0 release, documenting its ninth governed MCP tool and the pinned Linux arm64 image-review path while preserving provider-free, no-network, and separate-approval boundaries.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog, offline AAS Core data, marketplaces, bundles, and Codex/Claude plugin distributions for 2,003 skills.

### Security

- Closed the August Codex Security sweep by making image review symlink-safe, treating project scripts and credentials as untrusted, pinning the GitHub attachment helper, confining Loki cleanup, loading PR-policy dependencies only from protected `main`, scoping oversized MCP requests to bounded metadata, and removing the public Star History token.
- Pinned and bundled Ajv's `fast-uri` dependency on the patched 3.1.x line, resolving GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7 in the production dependency tree.
- Updated the web app's PostCSS and transitive brace-expansion and ip-address tooling to patched releases, clearing the remaining local npm audit findings.
- Refreshed the bundled `loki-mode` todo example lockfiles to patched `ip-address` and PostCSS releases, clearing the remaining Dependabot findings in the canonical skill and generated Claude mirror.

### Who should care

- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity users who install skills from the canonical or plugin distributions.
- Security-conscious teams relying on bounded MCP framing, protected CI dependencies, credential handling, or container-image review guidance.
- Creators using Gemini image or video generation who need explicit cost approval and reproducible prompt metadata.
- Shopify app teams triaging low-star public reviews without treating unverified reports as confirmed incidents.

### Validation

- Resolved all 22 findings from the August Codex Security sweep: 19 verified fixes and 3 documented false positives; the refreshed open-findings view is empty.
- Passed canonical skill and reference validation, documentation security, warning-budget enforcement, the complete 106-group repository suite, the 150-test AAS Core suite, web build and prerender, and package dry-run checks.
- Confirmed root and web-app npm audits report zero vulnerabilities and protected `main` CI and CodeQL are green before release preparation.

- Added [`fact-check-x-complete`](skills/fact-check-x-complete/) as the complete official Fact-Check-X workflow for capturing and comparing claims, citations, screenshots, and HTML evidence across supported AI platforms.

### Changed

- Updated [`find-complementary-founders`](skills/find-complementary-founders/) to surface a tentative founder, operator, go-to-market, or scaling complement hypothesis from active-task evidence before offering the private Canvas and owner-controlled public-profile flow.
- Made direct Antigravity installation fail closed before cloning or writing when no skill selection is supplied. The installer now directs users to let a Codex or Claude agent choose exact IDs through the read-only AAS Core MCP, preview the resulting `--skills` install, and use `--all` only as explicit acceptance of full-catalog context and crash-loop risk. Other host targets retain their existing behavior.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog and Codex/Claude distribution surfaces for 1,997 skills.

### Who should care

- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and Antigravity users who need auditable knowledge, verification, or machine-handoff workflows.

- Updated Modellix vendored source URLs and speech defaults, upgraded the catalog web app to `@supabase/supabase-js` 2.111.0, and normalized indexable catalog links for GitHub Pages.

### Security

- Removed mutable provider instructions from BrowserAct's operating-policy boundary and required full 40-character Git commit pins for linked FindMate profiles.
- Strengthened installation safety for offensive and externally sourced skills with explicit authorization, command confirmation, provenance inspection, and immutable source pins.
- Hardened Cohesivity credential files to private permissions and documented privacy, retention, billing, overage, and x402 self-payment boundaries.

### Who should care

- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and Antigravity users who want actionable risk metadata before installing or running skills.
- Security-conscious teams auditing offensive, networked, credential-bearing, or externally sourced skills.
- Maintainers running large repository-wide skill reviews through the protected evidence and merge workflow.
- Developers who need a consent-gated, agent-provisioned backend without manually copying credentials.

### Validation

- Regenerated the canonical catalog and distribution surfaces for 1,993 skills.

### Changed

- Expanded [`apify-ultimate-scraper`](skills/apify-ultimate-scraper/) with Xquik X Actors guidance for authenticated X/Twitter extraction, including explicit legal, privacy, and credential-handling boundaries.
- Updated the [`modellix`](skills/modellix/) provenance record after its verified upstream repository rename, preserving the stable repository identity and canonical source link.
- Added a protected-base exception ledger for verified upstream repository renames while keeping all unverified provenance changes fail-closed.
- Hardened BrowserAct guidance with a pinned CLI version, untrusted-runtime-guide handling, explicit confirmation gates, and disclosures for telemetry, error reporting, machine identification, CAPTCHA services, and remote assistance.

### Who should care

- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Windsurf users who need browser-backed automation with explicit approval and data-exposure boundaries.
- SRE and platform teams diagnosing CPU, memory, storage, network, thread-state, and application latency regressions.
- Maintainers who need upstream repository renames to retain provenance without weakening the source-identity gate.

### Validation

- Passed canonical skill and reference validation, documentation security, warning-budget enforcement, changed-skill evidence, repository tests, protected CI, and CodeQL.
- Confirmed canonical synchronization reproduced the new skills across Codex and Claude plugin distributions and left generated state drift-free.
- The protected release gate will bind the release PR, tag, GitHub Release, npm `latest`, CI, CodeQL, release-only Pages deployment, live catalog and legacy bridge, and every already-configured AAS MCP host to the exact released commit.

## [15.5.1] - 2026-07-27 - "MCP Client Compatibility"

> Restored AAS MCP connectivity for newer clients while preserving an explicit, fail-closed protocol boundary.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Fixed

- Fixed AAS MCP initialization for newer clients such as Claude Code 2.1.x by negotiating the server-supported protocol revision instead of rejecting every request that advertises a different revision ([#1003](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/issues/1003)).

### Who should care

- Claude Code 2.1.x users whose MCP clients advertise protocol revision `2025-11-25`.
- Other MCP clients that advertise a revision newer than the server-supported `2025-06-18` revision.
- Integrators that require malformed or missing protocol revisions to remain rejected.

### Validation

- Passed direct server, stdio binary, isolated packed-runtime, and release-preview negotiation tests.
- Passed the 150-test AAS Core suite, the 102-file repository suite, catalog integrity, reference validation, documentation security, warning-budget enforcement, protected CI, and CodeQL.

### Credits

- **[@rk2kaler](https://github.com/rk2kaler)** for reporting the protocol negotiation regression with a complete reproduction in [issue #1003](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/issues/1003).

## [15.5.0] - 2026-07-26 - "Coordination, Founder Matching, and Fedora Hyprland"

> Added focused multi-agent orchestration, privacy-preserving founder matching, and a consent-gated Fedora Hyprland lifecycle workflow; also expanded UIZZE with a free manual path and a harder UI finish gate.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Added

- Added [`orchestrate`](skills/orchestrate/) for delegating independent, large-scope work to focused agents while keeping trivial tasks with the coordinator and preserving user-held approval boundaries.
- Added [`find-complementary-founders`](skills/find-complementary-founders/) for private owner assessment, consent-gated pseudonymous profiles, locally ranked complementary founder candidates, expiry controls, and explicit privacy boundaries.
- Added [`fedora-hyprland-installer`](skills/fedora-hyprland-installer/) for GPU-aware Fedora Hyprland preflight, backup, installation, configuration, verification, scoped repair, and confirmation-gated removal across NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and hybrid systems.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog and distribution surfaces for 1,991 skills.

### Changed

- Expanded [`uizze-ui-research`](skills/uizze-ui-research/) with a useful no-account manual workflow, explicit evidence labels, a consent-gated rendered HTML/CSS preview, and a hard pre-ship finish gate.
- Hardened the Fedora workflow with immutable source and license provenance, critical-risk classification, explicit approval before privileged changes, diagnostic-only repair by default, current NVIDIA guidance, and isolated tests.
- Clarified that founder-match rankings are decision aids rather than evidence that a candidate is available, interested, or committed.

### Fixed

- Updated the hosted catalog's ESLint toolchain to the ESLint 10-compatible dependency set, removing the high-severity `brace-expansion` and `minimatch` advisory chain that would otherwise block the release-only Pages deployment.

### Who should care

- Codex users coordinating multiple independent implementation or research lanes.
- Founders and agents who need privacy-preserving, owner-approved matching instead of profiling strangers or mining private data.
- Fedora users adopting Hyprland while preserving an existing GNOME or KDE installation.
- Product teams needing UIZZE-backed UI research or a bounded manual finish gate without requiring a full hosted connection.

### Validation

- Passed canonical skill and reference validation, documentation security checks, warning-budget enforcement, repository tests, changed-skill evidence, and plugin and bundle parity checks.
- Exercised the Fedora detection and isolated script suites and compiled and smoke-tested the founder-matching Python utilities.
- Confirmed the protected canonical synchronization reproduced all three new skills across Codex and Claude plugin distributions.
- The protected release gate will bind the source and release PRs, canonical synchronization, tag, GitHub Release, npm `latest`, CI, CodeQL, release-only Pages deployment, live catalog and legacy bridge, and every already-configured AAS MCP host to the exact released commit.

## [15.4.0] - 2026-07-24 - "SEO Drift and Dependency Safety"

> Added official SEO regression monitoring, closed the current high-severity frontend dependency advisories, and refreshed contributor and conduct links while preserving the protected release workflow.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Added

- Added the official [`seo-drift`](skills/seo-drift/) skill from [nowork-studio/NotFair](https://github.com/nowork-studio/NotFair) for dated SEO baselines and regression detection across rankings, indexation, metadata, directives, schema, and on-page elements.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog and distribution surfaces for 1,988 skills.

### Changed

- Shortened PR feedback by parallelizing independent validation, cancelling superseded PR runs, and removing repeated canonical setup and catalog generation; also removed retired workflow/retry code and bound Pages deployments to the exact published release tag.
- Added trusted-base fork fail-fast intake and shadow impact telemetry without weakening `merge:batch`; source validation now generates one exact-head preview manifest for verification, canonical checks split exact-tree reproduction from drift confirmation, and local timing/sharding remains observational and opt-in while required CI stays complete.

### Fixed

- Updated PostCSS to 8.5.18 in the hosted web app and canonical Loki frontend example, resolving GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849 while preserving canonical and generated-mirror lock parity.
- Migrated the hosted catalog from `react-router-dom` 7 to the patched `react-router` 8.3.0 API surface, resolving GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2 without the unsafe 7.11.0 downgrade.
- Replaced obsolete GitHub abuse-reporting and Pro Git links, and removed three dead or unsupported localized community destinations.

### Who should care

- Maintainers and Pages operators who require a zero-advisory web build and reproducible example locks.
- SEO teams using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or Antigravity to detect regressions after migrations and content changes.
- Contributors following the repository's conduct, Git, and localized community guidance.

### Validation

- Confirmed all six tracked npm lockfile surfaces report zero known vulnerabilities after the dependency updates.
- Passed canonical skill and reference validation, documentation security checks, warning-budget enforcement, repository tests, web tests, lint and production build, Loki frontend builds, plugin and bundle parity checks, and repository consistency checks.
- The protected release gate will bind the source and release PRs, canonical synchronization, tag, GitHub Release, npm `latest`, CI, CodeQL, release-only Pages deployment, live catalog and legacy bridge, and every already-configured AAS MCP host to the exact released commit.

### Credits

- **[@ununununium](https://github.com/ununununium)** and **[nowork-studio/NotFair](https://github.com/nowork-studio/NotFair)** for the official `seo-drift` contribution in [PR #974](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/pull/974).

## [15.3.0] - 2026-07-22 - "Security Boundaries and Maintainer Reliability"

> Hardened AAS Core, skill distribution, the hosted catalog, and protected maintenance and release workflows; resolved current dependency advisories and the native Windows preview failure reported in discussion #956 without changing the 1,987-skill catalog.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Changed

- Expanded semantic-review and merge evidence from `SKILL.md` to every tracked file under a canonical skill subtree, including nested examples, scripts, lockfiles, references, assets, deletions, and plugin skill mirrors. Deleted or otherwise unresolvable skill trees now require exact-head manual review instead of silently producing a successful no-skill result.
- Restricted sensitive same-repository action approval to owner-authored PRs with exact 40-character reviewed-head attestation, and made protected release publication accept exactly one same-repository, owner-authored PR with the expected title, base, and `release/vX.Y.Z` branch.
- Marked `anywrite` and `sshepherd` blocked in Codex and Claude plugin distributions until users provide separately installed, reviewed executables by explicit absolute path; the canonical source skills remain in the catalog.
- Hardened `cloudflare-security-audit`, `hf-cloud-aws-context-discovery`, `pptx-deck-creation`, and `weaviate-cookbooks` against cross-repository evidence reuse, credential exposure, prompt injection from design references, and predictable temporary installer paths.

### Fixed

- Fixed native Windows Codex configuration preview so ACL checks pass paths through the environment, tolerate unresolved inherited ACE names, and return bounded path, phase, and status diagnostics for `AAS_ADAPTER_WINDOWS_ACL_FAILED`.
- Hardened AAS Core runtime state: validate the complete cache-ancestor chain, bound per-session manifest state to 128 entries, preserve broader neutral search results for exact-ID queries, and surface directory-durability failures during transactional cleanup.
- Removed the catalog markdown URL bypass, required exact release metadata in `llms.txt`, and rejected symlinked or escaping files in the legacy Pages redirect verifier.
- Fixed changed-skill evidence for arbitrary nested bundle files, full-directory Tessl fingerprints, deleted skill trees, canonical-sync Pages suppression, and workflow and documentation contract drift; canonical synchronization no longer dispatches release-only Pages builds.
- Updated `brace-expansion` to 1.1.16, `body-parser` to 1.20.6, and `fast-uri` to 3.1.4, resolving the live Dependabot findings and affected npm audit results.
- Pinned published README links to the release-specific AAS Core guide and made release-state synchronization preserve that immutable version binding.

### Who should care

- Native Windows Codex users configuring AAS Core.
- Maintainers merging skill bundles, canonical syncs, or protected releases.
- Users of plugin distributions and security, cloud, and deck-generation skills.
- Operators relying on Core cache, transaction, evidence, or legacy Pages verification boundaries.

### Validation

- Passed canonical skill and reference validation, documentation security checks, workflow linting, warning-budget enforcement, repository tests, web tests and build, deterministic regeneration, protected CI, and CodeQL on the merged source and canonical-sync commits.
- Confirmed all six tracked lockfile surfaces report zero known npm vulnerabilities before release preparation, with zero open Dependabot, code-scanning, or secret-scanning alerts.
- The release gate will verify tag, GitHub Release, npm `latest`, the release-only Pages deployment, live catalog and legacy bridge, and every already-configured AAS MCP host against the exact released commit.

## [15.2.0] - 2026-07-21 - "Credited Skills and Release Reliability"

> Expanded the catalog to 1,987 source-verified skills, clarified the AAS Core product boundary, and strengthened protected release alignment across npm, plugins, public surfaces, and configured MCP hosts.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Added

- Added ten official Markstream skills: `markstream-angular`, `markstream-custom-components`, `markstream-migration`, `markstream-nuxt`, `markstream-react`, `markstream-svelte`, `markstream-vue`, `markstream-vue2`, `markstream-vue2-cli`, and `markstream-vue2-vite`.
- Added seven n8n workflow-specialist skills: `n8n-agents`, `n8n-binary-and-data`, `n8n-code-tool`, `n8n-error-handling`, `n8n-multi-instance`, `n8n-subworkflows`, and `using-n8n-mcp-skills`.
- Added the official Hugging Face `hf-cloud-aws-context-discovery` skill for resolving the effective AWS profile, region, account, and caller identity before cloud work.
- Retained the local reference material required by the imported Markstream and n8n skills, and added the node-family compatibility reference to the existing `n8n-node-configuration` skill.

### Changed

- Hardened `markstream-install` and the imported guidance around dependency installation, project mutation, credentials, instance selection, workflow side effects, and cloud-planning boundaries.
- Aligned the README, hosted catalog, localized documentation, SEO metadata, Workbench copy, and package surfaces with the implemented AAS Core model: coding agents choose exact skills, while Core provides neutral catalog access, structural validation, durable state, and immutable plan preview rather than semantic recommendation.
- Expanded the AAS Core guide with an exact version-pinned MCP setup command, a copyable end-to-end quick path, a preview-status matrix, and explicit boundaries between structural validity, semantic suitability, compatibility, setup correctness, and operational safety.
- Made full release alignment mandatory across generated registries, Codex and Claude mirrors, editorial bundles, plugin manifests, marketplaces, GitHub Release, npm dist-tags, CI, CodeQL, Pages, public catalog routes, and every already-configured local AAS MCP host.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog, compatibility data, plugin mirrors, bundles, marketplaces, and public discovery surfaces for 1,987 skills.

### Fixed

- Fixed same-version protected release retries so release staging includes the generated AAS Core version pin and publication selects the latest successfully merged protected release candidate.
- Added regression guards that prevent generated metadata and public surfaces from restoring stale recommender claims or obsolete fixed catalog counts.

### Who should care

- Frontend teams using Markstream across Vue, React, Svelte, Angular, Nuxt, and Vue 2 projects.
- n8n builders working with agents, Code nodes, binary data, error handling, multi-instance deployments, and subworkflows.
- Hugging Face and AWS users who need reliable account and region discovery before cloud operations.
- AAS Core operators who depend on reproducible, version-pinned releases and inspectable agent-selected stacks.

### Validation

- Audited all 208 credited repositories and selected 18 additions with usable source material, compatible licensing, clear provenance, and acceptable semantic and safety boundaries; unresolved, unsafe, or incomplete candidates were excluded.
- Passed canonical skill validation, reference validation, documentation security checks, credit and source-chain checks, repository tests, protected CI, and CodeQL for the released commit.
- Published npm package `15.2.0` and verified the configured local AAS MCP host with a real `initialize` and `tools/list` handshake against version `15.2.0`.

### Known issue

- The release-only Pages deployment was blocked by a high-severity transitive dependency advisory, so the live catalog remained on `15.1.0` pending a dependency refresh and follow-up release.

### Credits

- **[@Simon-He95](https://github.com/Simon-He95)** and **[Simon-He95/markstream-vue](https://github.com/Simon-He95/markstream-vue)** for the official Markstream skill family.

## [15.1.0] - 2026-07-19 - "Agent-Owned Selection and Audit Evidence"

> AAS Core now leaves semantic skill selection to the coding agent, validates the exact chosen stack, and emits durable evidence that can be reviewed without exposing project content.

Start here:

- AAS Core setup: configure the exact `aas` runtime with the [Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/aas-core.md)
- Direct skill distribution: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

### Added

- Added the canonical `aas-selection-evidence.json` sidecar, with a server-owned MCP process trace, agent-declared ten-dimension capability ledger, path-safe project fingerprint, catalog and manifest binding, and structural-only inspection through `export_selection_evidence` and `inspect_selection_evidence`.
- Added an audit-enabled CLI artifact-directory path that validates and publishes `aas-stack.json` and `aas-selection-evidence.json` together with a single durable directory rename, while preserving the existing manifest-only command.
- Added the official `markstream-install` skill for integrating streaming Markdown renderers across Vue, React, Svelte, Angular, Nuxt, Next.js, and Vue 2 applications (PR #940).

### Changed

- Added an MCP session-level capability coverage contract for Codex and Claude: agents must enumerate primary project capabilities, search and compare candidates for each, cover every capability or report a catalog gap, and avoid smallest-stack optimization before `compose_stack`. Core imposes no semantic small-stack policy; each manifest retains an explicit technical maximum of 128 skills.
- Moved semantic skill selection fully to Codex and Claude: agents inspect the project, search and read the complete local catalog, and choose exact skill IDs using their own judgment; AAS Core no longer ranks or recommends skills.
- Replaced the recommendation workflow with read-only `compose_stack`, which validates and returns the agent-owned manifest in memory; clients or the CLI persist `aas-stack.json` for inspection, validation, and immutable plan preview.
- Removed Core selection policy and metadata eligibility gates. Every canonical skill is searchable, readable, and available for agent selection; risk, source, setup, compatibility, review, and evidence metadata are informational only.
- Made `search_skills` retrieval neutral: matching results preserve stable catalog order and no longer expose relevance scores or ranking while exact-ID lookup and complete pagination remain deterministic.
- Updated the public product narrative, host guides, Workbench-facing copy sources, package metadata, and maintainer workflow to describe the agent-owned selection boundary. Released entries below remain historical descriptions of their releases.

### Fixed

- Preserved bounded, path-safe schema diagnostics across Core and MCP errors so invalid profiles identify the logical field, validation keyword, and applicable limit without echoing input values, unknown property names, schema internals, or filesystem paths.
- Corrected current public Core examples to use manifest schema 2 with `profile` and exact agent-selected IDs, with a regression test spanning English, Chinese, Vietnamese, integration, and hosted-app copy.
- Marked all five local MCP tools explicitly read-only, non-destructive, idempotent, and closed-world so isolated non-interactive Codex clients can invoke the catalog workflow without treating the calls as approval-gated mutations.
- Restored and protected CLI topic-page SEO metadata so generated titles, descriptions, and catalog routes retain their topic-specific contract.

### Validation

- Passed the protected repository CI and all CodeQL analyzers on the final pre-release `main` commit, including the packed Core preview and dynamic catalog enumeration regressions.

### Credits

- **[@Simon-He95](https://github.com/Simon-He95)** and **[Simon-He95/markstream-vue](https://github.com/Simon-He95/markstream-vue)** for the official `markstream-install` skill (PR #940).

## [15.0.0] - 2026-07-18 - "AAS Core: Local Composition and Reviewable Plans"

> AAS Core becomes the primary product: a local, deterministic engine shared by the `aas` CLI and read-only `aas-mcp`, taking coding agents from an explicit project profile to an explainable recommendation, `aas-stack.json`, validation, and immutable plan preview before any target change.

### Added

- Added a repository-canonical `antigravity-maintainer-batch-release` skill so external clones can follow the mandatory protected maintainer workflow without relying on a machine-local copy.
- Added a public AAS Core guide covering the local agent-first MCP flow, `aas-stack.json`, CLI validation and immutable plan preview, Workbench review, privacy boundaries, and the current preview qualification.

### Changed

- Made the OSS Maintainer bundle self-contained, made the Git pushing helper portable outside this repository, and removed dead maintenance-skill references.
- Aligned secondary user guides, hosted discovery copy, Workbench verification labels, and an ImageGen-produced social card with the AAS Core product hierarchy while preserving direct-distribution, contributor, governance, and historical content.
- Clarified the first-screen AAS Core narrative with one primary product, an explicit project-profile trust boundary, a single Core CTA, and durable generator guards that keep future metadata syncs from restoring the legacy library-first headline.
- Reduced the Core preview workflow to one packed Linux/Node LTS smoke path plus Workbench review, while retaining release-time validation for publication.
- Recentered the README, user onboarding, host guides, package metadata, and hosted catalog narrative on AAS Core while preserving contributor, catalog, plugin, bundle, workflow, compatibility, community, and source-credit content.
- Expanded the curated hosted sitemap from 42 to 180 deterministic skill routes and added crawlable static home/topic fallbacks so search engines can discover useful catalog hubs without mass-indexing the full library.
- Enriched the four search-intent landing pages with real recommended skills, stronger internal links, and matching `ItemList` structured data while preserving canonical trailing-slash identities.
- Replaced the marketing-only homepage heading with a descriptive AI-agent-skills heading while retaining the existing slogan as supporting copy.

### Fixed

- Fixed invalid `aas stack validate` manifests so the CLI returns the documented structured error and non-zero exit status.
- Corrected the AAS Core release boundary, Workbench artifact-review flow, localized and search-facing narrative, and npm packaging assertions without changing contributor, governance, community, or historical sections.
- Removed the retired certified-v1 verifier corpus, six-job harnesses, tuning runner, paused optimization workflows, heuristic local reviewer, lexical risk inference, and quality-score merge regressions. Objective validation, reference, security, provenance, Tessl-or-exact-head semantic review, and protected canonical-sync gates remain.
- Made the future AAS Core npm onboarding release-safe by linking the published README to the canonical Core guide and deriving the plan runtime version from the manifest catalog identity instead of hardcoding a release number.
- Added the current Bing Webmaster verification identity and updated the legacy Pages redirect generator contract to cover the expanded 187-route sitemap.
- Expanded the legacy Pages bridge to every one of the 1,968 current catalog skills plus seven structural routes, while keeping crawler discovery limited to the curated 187-route sitemap and making migration-readiness checks enforce the same exact catalog coverage.
- Corrected public Workbench copy that implied browser-side install-command generation; Workbench reviews user-supplied Core stack and plan artifacts without filesystem access or installation.

### Validation

- Verified the published `15.0.0-rc.3` package end to end in a fresh real Codex client: official MCP configuration, native `search_skills`, `get_skill`, `recommend_stack`, and `inspect_stack` calls, a valid agent-proposed `aas-stack.json`, packaged CLI validation, and immutable read-only plan preview without apply or recovery.
- Passed repository validation, reference and documentation-security checks, AAS Core tests, web-app coverage and build, package-content checks, protected CI, CodeQL, Dependency Review, Snyk, Socket, and npm publication verification.

## [15.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-07-18 - "AAS Core Onboarding Candidate"

> Supersedes `15.0.0-rc.2` after real Codex validation exposed three onboarding defects. This candidate remains on npm's `next` channel until the complete fresh-client flow passes without workarounds.

### Fixed

- Allowed the official runtime bootstrap to create a private AAS cache under a normal real user configuration directory without requiring the parent directory itself to be private.
- Published exact nested MCP input schemas for recommendation profiles, targets, policy, and stack manifests, and aligned `projectType` with the Core recommendation contract.
- Directed MCP clients to validate every proposed `aas-stack.json` with `inspect_stack` before handing it to the CLI, preventing malformed manifest contracts from reaching `stack validate`.

### Validation

- `15.0.0-rc.2` proved real Codex discovery and invocation of `search_skills`, `get_skill`, and `recommend_stack`, but stable promotion was stopped because bootstrap required a cache workaround and the agent-proposed manifest failed CLI validation.
- Stable `15.0.0` remains gated on repeating the full fresh-client flow with the packaged `15.0.0-rc.3` runtime and packaged CLI, ending in successful manifest validation and read-only plan preview.

## [15.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-07-18 - "AAS Core Release Candidate"

> Supersedes the unpublished `15.0.0-rc.1` candidate after hardening prerelease metadata synchronization. This candidate is published on npm's `next` channel for real-client validation before the stable 15.0.0 release.

### Fixed

- Made prerelease metadata synchronization idempotent across the README and crawler-facing release metadata, including repeated RC syncs and the later RC-to-stable transition.
- Reprepared the protected release candidate from the exact post-fix `main` lineage so the release tag, generated state, and published package share one verified source identity.

### Validation

- Stable `15.0.0` remains gated on a fresh Codex client discovering and invoking the packaged AAS MCP, followed by packaged CLI validation and read-only plan preview.

## [15.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-18 - "AAS Core Release Candidate (Unpublished)"

> Prepared as the first AAS Core release candidate but not tagged or published; superseded by `15.0.0-rc.2` after prerelease metadata synchronization was hardened.

### Added

- Added the local, deterministic AAS Core shared by the `aas` CLI and local stdio MCP, with catalog search, skill inspection, explainable stack recommendation, manifest validation, immutable plan preview, and read-only diagnosis.
- Added the versioned `aas-stack.json` and plan contracts, integrity-bound offline catalog runtime, Codex and Claude MCP configuration flow, and browser-local Workbench artifact review.

### Changed

- Repositioned the repository around AAS Core while preserving the catalog, plugins, bundles, workflows, direct installers, compatibility documentation, contributor guidance, governance, community, credits, and historical release notes.
- Raised the supported Node.js runtime to 22 or newer and made prereleases publish explicitly to npm's `next` channel while stable releases publish to `latest`.
- Kept target mutation outside the supported preview claim: `stack apply` and `stack recover` remain experimental and opt-in.

### Fixed

- Removed obsolete heuristic reviewer, lexical risk classifier, score gates, certified-v1 evaluation corpus, and paused optimization machinery that produced false positives or unnecessary merge friction. Objective validation, reference, security, provenance, protected canonical synchronization, and Tessl-or-exact-head semantic review remain.
- Made AAS Core release capability explicit in package metadata so future documentation and release synchronization no longer depend on hardcoded version strings.

### Validation

- This candidate is intentionally published before the stable release so a fresh Codex client can discover and invoke the packaged AAS MCP and the packaged CLI can validate and preview the proposed stack end to end.

## [14.6.0] - 2026-07-16 - "Diagnostics, Review Efficiency, and Protected Maintenance"

> Three new skills for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Antigravity, and other agent workflows: Android overheating diagnosis, evidence-labeled competitor ad research, and uncertainty-aware campaign optimization, backed by more reliable Tessl review and protected maintainer automation.

## Start Here

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills@14.6.0`
- [Choose your tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- [Best skills by tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- [Bundles](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- [Workflows](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

## Added

- Added **diagnose-android-overheating**, a read-only-first Android and HyperOS investigation workflow for correlating thermal state, power use, wakelocks, radio activity, and workload evidence without treating one snapshot as proof (PR #854).
- Added **competitor-ad-intelligence** for evidence-labeled competitor paid-ad research across public libraries, landing pages, offer structure, and creative patterns while keeping observations separate from inference (PR #852).
- Added **ad-campaign-analyzer** for diagnosing campaign efficiency and proposing bounded budget reallocation tests with uncertainty, measurement quality, and rollback conditions made explicit (PR #853).

## Changed

- Made repository maintenance consistently pull-request-only across maintainer policy and the `git-pushing`, `git-pr-workflows-git-workflow`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `github-automation`, and `repo-maintainer` skills (PR #864).
- Extended `merge:batch` to support same-repository maintainer PRs while keeping external PRs behind the strict fork content allowlist, trusted changed-skill evidence, exact-head review, required checks, and protected `main`.
- Regenerated the canonical catalog, hosted assets, skill indexes, plugin bundles, and Claude/Codex mirrors for 1,965 skills.

## Fixed

- Corrected Tessl workspace selection and added a repository-variable override for future workspace migrations (PRs #856 and #858).
- Reused successful Tessl review only for an identical changed-skill fingerprint, conserving review credits without weakening semantic-review truthfulness; explicit quota failures now route to exact-head manual review while unrelated failures remain fail-closed (PR #860).
- Bound PR body-refresh retries to newly materialized workflow and check-suite IDs, preventing older runs on the same commit from satisfying or failing a refreshed merge gate (PR #864).
- Made check selection prefer workflow creation time over late completion time and added regression coverage for delayed fork approvals, fresh Skill Review suites, and internal maintainer batches.

## Validation

- Passed protected `pr-policy`, `pr-evidence`, `source-validation`, and `artifact-preview` checks for every source and canonical-sync PR in the cycle.
- Passed Tessl review for the five updated maintenance skills with scores of 93, 99, 88, 93, and 96 against the required threshold of 80.
- Passed the full repository suite, documentation security, reference validation, warning-budget enforcement, Dependency Review, Snyk, Socket, all CodeQL analyzers, canonical mirror checks, and final Pages deployment.
- Verified the three new skills and updated maintenance metadata on the live hosted catalog.

## Credits

## [14.5.0] - 2026-07-15 - "Private Context, Optimization, and Local Operations"

> Four reviewed community skills for private session-derived profiles, bounded parameter optimization, credential-isolated SSH operations, and low-context Anytype automation, with maintainer hardening and synchronized distributions.

## Added

- Added **ditto** for extracting private, session-derived context into a local profile without introducing fork-supplied executable runtime files (PR #842).
- Added **optim-agent** for bounded parameter optimization and evidence-driven tuning workflows (PR #844).
- Added **sshepherd** for credential-isolated SSH operations with explicit remote-operation boundaries (PR #846).
- Added **anywrite** for low-context Anytype workspace automation and safe local writes (PR #847).

## Changed

- Classified session mining, remote infrastructure operations, and mutable local workspace automation at `critical` risk.
- Made Ditto require an existing trusted runtime instead of accepting executable bootstrap code supplied by a fork.
- Synchronized the canonical catalog, plugin mirrors, contributor/source credits, web assets, and public discovery surfaces for 1,962+ skills.

## Fixed

- Added missing source credits for `sshepherd` and `anywrite` and resolved overlapping README credit changes without dropping either source.

## Validation

- Passed exact-head policy, evidence, source-validation, artifact-preview, and skill-review gates for PRs #842, #844, #846, and #847.
- Passed consistency and maintainer audits, the root and web-app suites, CodeQL, and Pages deployment; verified all four skills on the live catalog.

## [14.4.0] - 2026-07-14 - "Protected Automation and Production Skills"

> Ten reviewed community skills for durable project memory, software-graph analysis, Cloudflare and codebase guardrails, data warehousing, and presentation production, backed by protected exact-commit maintainer automation.

## Added

- Added **feature-tracking** for durable feature decisions, implementation state, and project memory across sessions (PR #819).
- Added **ontoly-software-graph** for querying and reasoning over Ontoly software knowledge graphs (PR #827).
- Added **cloudflare-security-audit** plus the **clean-code**, **documentation**, **testing**, **WooCommerce**, and **WordPress** guard skills (PR #822).
- Added **warehouse** for production-oriented data warehouse architecture and implementation workflows (PR #818).
- Added **pptx-deck-creation** for structured PowerPoint research, authoring, rendering, and visual QA (PR #830).

## Changed

- Protected canonical repository writers with exact pull-request and commit binding, trusted regression gates, fail-closed approval handling, and a single guarded canonical-sync path.
- Restored the explicit fork-approval flow while preventing workflow runs from being reused across unrelated pull requests or head commits.
- Improved curated plugin bundle composition, tracked ignored Claude mirror files correctly, and combined npm package-rename traffic without double counting.
- Made hosted catalog SEO identities reproducible across canonical URLs, social metadata, sitemaps, and prerendered output.

## Fixed

- Closed the two open Security and Quality findings by declaring least-privilege workflow permissions and making the SEO package-identity regression test exact.
- Made skill review fail closed when same-repository credentials are missing, while preserving the explicit manual-review path for forks.
- Hardened Lore mirror targets against traversal and symlink escapes, Telegram approvals against unauthorized group senders and token leakage through process arguments, and Auto Research against implicit external-query disclosure.
- Restored legacy Git ref-format detection, updated the redirect bridge to the current 49-route sitemap, and made Go In Depth reject non-string query inputs cleanly.
- Regenerated ephemeral plugin mirrors and the skill index before source-only PR tests so contributions can satisfy distribution and Workbench contracts without committing generated artifacts.

## Validation

- Added regression coverage for workflow fail-closed behavior, mirror containment guidance, Telegram authorization and token transport, legacy Git, production redirect counts, and non-string research queries.
- Passed the canonical 1,958-skill validation and reference checks, full root test suite, documentation security gate, web-app coverage and production build, npm high-severity audit, package dry run, CodeQL, and protected exact-head PR checks.

## [14.3.1] - 2026-07-13 - "Expert Workbench and Community Surface Cleanup"

> A public expert workbench for exact, inspectable skill sets, with the rejected maintainer-only product removed from the current installable distribution.

## Added

- Added the hosted **Expert Skill Workbench** for searching recorded catalog fields and filtering category, risk, provenance, host compatibility, and setup burden across all 1,948 canonical skills (PR #815).
- Added exact skill selection, raw evidence warnings, shareable selection/host URLs, and package-and-release-pinned preview/install commands that fail closed for missing or explicitly incompatible IDs.
- Added a canonical-data contract proving every Workbench skill ID resolves exactly once through the real installer.

## Changed

- Made the static web skill count, release version, Workbench route, sitemap entry, prerender route, and `llms.txt` discovery surface part of the canonical metadata/build contract.
- Kept the general-purpose review, Git, changelog, and validation skills independently available in the full catalog instead of packaging them as a maintainer product.

## Removed

- Retired **AAS OSS Maintainer** from the editorial manifest, specialized-plugin candidates, hosted plugin catalog, README, plugin guides, Claude/Codex marketplaces, and generated plugin distribution (PR #816).

## Fixed

- Made bundle-retirement tests compatible with source-only pull requests while retaining an isolated regression test that proves canonical sync deletes stale generated plugin directories.

## Validation

- Passed source-only PR policy, Dependency Review, Snyk, Socket, all CodeQL analyzers, repository validation, reference checks, documentation security, the full root test suite, and bundle synchronization tests.
- Passed 115 web-app tests and coverage gates, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, prerender, SEO verification, sitemap validation, Pages deployment, and live Workbench interaction checks.

## [14.3.0] - 2026-07-13 - "Exact Selection, Safe Preview, and Community Memory"

> Version-pinned exact skill sets for active users and teams, plus two reviewed community skills with maintainer safety and correctness hardening.

## Added

- Added `--skills <csv>` for exact canonical skill names, IDs, and nested paths, with unknown or ambiguous selectors rejected before target writes.
- Added `--dry-run` to show the pinned ref, exact selected skills, per-target installs or updates, stale managed removals, repository-clone migration, and ignored unsafe manifest entries without mutating targets.
- Added **lore**, a project-local Markdown memory workflow with five stdlib Python helpers, explicit mirror boundaries, and project-input trust controls (PR #810).
- Added **quit-sponsor**, an opt-in smoking-cessation support workflow aligned to current CDC, WHO, and NICE guidance with local-data and emergency-escalation boundaries (PR #809).

## Changed

- Preserved recorded top-level and nested metadata tags in the canonical generated skill index for downstream expert discovery.
- Preflight every selected target before the first multi-target mutation and treat `--skills` as explicit desired state for installer-managed entries.
- Corrected the documented `Wolfe-Jam/faf-skills` inventory from 17 skills to the seven currently published upstream (PR #811).

## Fixed

- Ignore unsafe managed paths from a local installer manifest instead of resolving or pruning outside the install root.
- Fixed `lore` candidate duplicate detection, clean helper failures, audit mutation wording, and higher-priority instruction boundaries before merge.
- Removed categorical cessation guidance from `quit-sponsor`; quit dates, abrupt cessation, gradual reduction, and medications now remain individualized and clinically bounded.

## Validation

- Added exact-selection, ambiguity, filter-intersection, stale-removal preview, unsafe-manifest, no-write, and multi-target atomicity coverage.
- Required fresh policy, source-validation, artifact-preview, and skill-review checks for PRs #809–#811, then regenerated canonical catalog and plugin surfaces.
- Ran strict repository validation, documentation security checks, the full root and web-app test suites, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, prerender, sitemap, and SEO verification.

## [14.2.0] - 2026-07-12 - "Workflow Reliability and UI Research"

> Three reviewed community skills for idea validation, deterministic AI workflows, and source-grounded UI research, with maintainer hardening and synchronized distributions.

## Added

- Added **idea-autopsy**, a consent-gated business-idea validation workflow with explicit mutation boundaries for `REJECTION.md` (PR #805).
- Added **nika**, a critical-risk workflow runner guide with provenance, paid-run safeguards, cost-limit caveats, trace verification, and explicit limitations (PR #806).
- Added **uizze-ui-research**, an official-source workflow for turning UIZZE references into implementation constraints without copying product identity or assets (PR #807).

## Changed

- Added the required community and official-source README credits for Nika and UIZZE.
- Regenerated canonical indexes, catalogs, web assets, bundle data, contributor surfaces, and Codex/Claude plugin mirrors for the 1,946-skill catalog.

## Validation

- Required fresh `pr-policy`, `source-validation`, `artifact-preview`, and `review` checks before each squash merge.
- Ran repository validation, warning-budget enforcement, README source-credit checks, documentation security checks, the full test suite, and canonical consistency synchronization.

## [14.1.0] - 2026-07-10 - "Maintainer Batch and Security Boundary Hardening"

> Four reviewed community contributions plus targeted hardening for third-party consultation, update, install, connector-routing, and workspace-instruction boundaries.

## Added

- Added a self-contained Flutter implementation playbook covering architecture, typed failures, testing, and performance guidance (PR #799).
- Added **auto-research** with explicit per-consultation approval and redaction requirements (PR #800).
- Added **apple-container**, **gemini-deep-research**, **grok-build**, **postgres-readonly-queries**, and **telegram-bot-messaging** (PR #801).
- Added **product-decision-agent** with Chinese product-decision playbooks, quality gate, and source-neutral metadata (PR #802).

## Fixed

- Hardened **ask-copilot** and both distributed plugin copies: no blanket path access for review and no shell construction from untrusted prompt text or filenames.
- Removed remote self-overwrite guidance from **deepapi** and made **browser-harness** updates explicitly user-approved.
- Replaced Pilot Protocol's predictable installer path with a private `mktemp` directory and cleanup trap.
- Require a user-confirmed Notion database ID before **trading-ledger** reads or writes trade data.
- Require explicit user approval before **atlas-contract** imports project-local `Atlas.md` clauses.

## Changed

- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This is a major release because the public project identity changed from **Antigravity Awesome Skills** to **Agentic Awesome Skills**. The rename reflects the catalog's broader role across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and other agentic coding environments while preserving Antigravity compatibility.

## Added

- Added **ask-copilot**, a critical-risk Copilot CLI consultation skill with explicit user-consent requirements for sending local context to GitHub Copilot and separate approval gates before any tool execution or workspace mutation (PR #792).

## Changed

- Promoted the renamed **Agentic Awesome Skills** identity as the canonical package, repository, hosted catalog, changelog, and public metadata surface.
- Refreshed **x-twitter-scraper** with current Xquik source metadata, MIT license provenance, SDK setup guidance, and official-source README placement (PR #794).
- Replaced the public social preview card with a PNG asset and updated web SEO verification to validate the 1200x630 PNG dimensions.

## Fixed

- Restored the missing `pytest-skill/reference/playbook.md` file in the canonical skill and both plugin mirrors, resolving the broken reference reported in issue #793.

## Validation

- Hardened and merged PR #792 after `Skills Registry CI`, `Skill Review`, `Dependency Review`, `CodeQL`, Socket, and Snyk checks passed.
- Verified and merged PR #794 after `Skills Registry CI`, `Skill Review`, `Dependency Review`, `CodeQL`, Socket, and Snyk checks passed.
- Reproduced issue #793 locally by confirming `pytest-skill` referenced `reference/playbook.md` while the distributed skill folders lacked the file, then restored it from the LambdaTest upstream source.
- Closed issue #793 after restoring the missing pytest reference file on `main`.

## [13.11.0] - 2026-07-05 - "Ledger Skills, WGM, and Loki Dependency Maintenance"

> Notion-backed ledger skills, a governed build-loop methodology, and synchronized dependency maintenance for the 1,901+ skill catalog.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Browse skills: [README.md#browse-1899-skills](README.md#browse-1899-skills)
- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This release ships the July 5 maintenance batch: three source-backed skills, README upstream credits, a maintainer-side Snyk dependency repair for the Loki generated todo example, and refreshed registry/public catalog state for the 1,901+ skill catalog.

## Added

- Added **time-ledger**, a critical-risk Notion skill that parses natural-language time reports into a user-owned Notion database while marking uncertain entries `To-confirm` instead of guessing (PR #777).
- Added **trading-ledger**, a critical-risk Notion trading journal skill that records thesis, plan, emotion, fills, closes, and reviews while explicitly avoiding financial advice and market-data lookups (PR #778).
- Added **wgm**, a safe meta skill for governed build loops with triage, alignment, planning, deterministic backpressure, holdout-scenario judging, and handoff audits (PR #782).
- Added README upstream credits for **cruisekkk/time-ledger**, **cruisekkk/trading-ledger**, and **agent-frontier/wgm**.

## Changed

- Updated the Loki generated todo backend example dependency `better-sqlite3` from `^12.10.0` to `^12.10.1` in both the canonical skill source and Claude plugin mirror, superseding the generated-only Snyk PR #779 with a source-synchronized maintainer patch.
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin compatibility metadata, plugin mirrors, public web skill assets, sitemap, package description, and README/docs counters for the 1,901+ skill catalog.

## Validation

- Verified and merged PR #777, PR #778, and PR #782 after required GitHub checks passed.
- Ran `npm run security:docs` and `git diff --check` for the Loki dependency maintenance patch.
- Ran `npm run validate:references`, `npm run check:readme-credits -- --base origin/main --head HEAD`, and `git diff --check` during the maintainer fixes for PR #778 and PR #782.
- Ran `npm run sync:repo-state` before release preparation.
- Ran the release prepare suite for v13.11.0, including reference validation, release-state sync, tests, web-app install, web-app build, and package dry run.
- Ran `cd apps/web-app && npm run verify:seo`.

- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Browse skills: [README.md#browse-1898-skills](README.md#browse-1898-skills)
- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This release ships the July 4 maintenance batch: two new source-backed skills, one ASO documentation improvement, repaired pull-request intake checks for fork contributions, generated registry and plugin mirror sync, and refreshed public catalog surfaces for the 1,898+ skill catalog.

## Added

- Added **wp-site-health-auditor**, a critical-risk WordPress Site Health skill that turns Site Health reports into risk-tiered, backup-first remediation plans with WP-CLI, PHP, `.htaccess`, cache, HTTPS, and rollback guidance (PR #775).
- Added **context-kit**, a critical-risk personal-context hygiene skill for safely evaluating, adapting, and installing Context Kit-style Personal Context Artifact workflows without leaking secrets or private Markdown context (PR #776).
- Added the **JDDavenport/context-kit** source reference to README Community Contributors so the new external-source-backed skill has explicit attribution.

## Changed

- Updated **app-store-optimization** with optional AppNiche external research tools for directional iOS revenue benchmarks and keyword opportunity checks, with retrieval-date and approximation guidance (PR #774).
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin compatibility metadata, plugin mirrors, public web skill assets, sitemap, package description, and README/docs counters for the 1,898+ skill catalog.

## Fixed

- Fixed PR intake CI by installing npm dependencies before `tools/scripts/pr_preflight.cjs` runs in the `pr-policy` job.
- Fixed `tools/scripts/pr_preflight.cjs` so GitHub Actions absolute `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` values are read correctly, with a regression test for absolute event paths.

## Validation

- Verified and merged PR #774, PR #775, and PR #776 after required GitHub checks passed.
- Ran `npm run test` after the PR intake fix.
- Ran `npm run sync:repo-state`.
- Ran `npm run validate` and `npm run security:docs` during the Context Kit repair pass.
- Ran `npm run check:readme-credits -- --base origin/main --head HEAD` for the Context Kit source-credit gate.

- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This release completes the July 3 maintenance batch after v13.8.0: the WorkorAI community skill, Autohand Code install notes, a web-app Supabase dependency refresh, generated registry and public catalog updates, and refreshed SEO/public surfaces for the 1,896+ skill catalog.

## Added

- Added **workorai**, a critical-risk WorkorAI MCP skill for candidate job search/application flows and employer job lifecycle, candidate discovery, invitations, and applicant review workflows (PR #773).
- Added Autohand Code as a documented host in the README tool matrix, badges, intro copy, and install FAQ using the generic `--path ~/.autohand/skills` and `--path .autohand/skills` installer flow (manual integration of PR #772).

## Changed

- Updated README metadata sync tooling so Autohand Code remains part of generated README copy instead of being removed by future maintainer sync runs.
- Updated the web app `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency manifest to `^2.110.0`, matching the current lockfile resolution and superseding the stale Snyk 2.108.1 upgrade PR (#770).
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin compatibility metadata, catalog data, sitemap, public web skill assets, package description, and README counters for the 1,896+ skill catalog.

## Validation

- Verified and merged PR #773 after GitHub reported it mergeable and external security checks were successful.
- Reviewed PR #772 and integrated its README changes against the current 13.8.0/1,896+ public copy instead of applying its stale 13.7.0 patch.
- Reviewed PR #770 and applied the newer resolved Supabase dependency state rather than downgrading from the current lockfile to 2.108.1.
- Ran `npm install @supabase/supabase-js@^2.110.0 --package-lock-only` in `apps/web-app` with 0 vulnerabilities.

This release packages the July 3 maintenance pass: one fully-checked community skill PR, generated registry and plugin mirror sync, public catalog counters, and a clean SEO/public-surface refresh for the 1,895+ skill catalog.

## Added

- Added **code-polish**, a constraint-based cleanup skill for professionalizing code comments, removing redundant or stale comment noise, and keeping behavior changes out of scope (PR #771).

## [13.7.0] - 2026-07-02 - "Security Hardening and Community Intake"

> Maintainer security sweep, PR maintenance, and catalog sync for the 1,894+ skill catalog.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Browse skills: [README.md#browse-1894-skills](README.md#browse-1894-skills)
- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This release packages the July 2 maintenance batch: three community PRs, hardening for the reviewed security findings CSV, generated registry and plugin mirror sync, and a catalog quality fix for product-risk skill categorization.

## Added

- Added **mdpr-skill**, a Codex-assisted MDPR presentation review skill for semantic hints, visual checks, theme candidates, and deterministic renderer boundaries (PR #767).
- Added **dispatch**, a multi-CLI delegation skill for routing work from Claude Code to Codex, Antigravity, and Gemini agents (PR #768).
- Added **before-you-build**, a product-risk review skill for checking demand, alternatives, switching costs, channels, and validation steps before coding (PR #769).

## Changed

- Hardened the `skill-review` workflow so Tessl credentials are only exposed to trusted, pinned setup steps while PR content is reviewed through repository-owned trusted scripts.
- Hardened **hugging-face-model-trainer** GGUF conversion by validating Hugging Face repo IDs and making `trust_remote_code` an explicit `TRUST_REMOTE_CODE` opt-in.
- Hardened **weaviate** connection handling so provider API keys are forwarded only through an explicit `WEAVIATE_PROVIDER_KEYS` allowlist.
- Reclassified **sql-sentinel** and **gh-image** as `critical` and removed them from generated Codex/Claude plugin mirrors until their upstream execution and browser-session guidance is reviewed for plugin distribution.
- Reclassified **riffkit** as `critical` because it can use a session token and paid generation endpoint.
- Fixed symlink handling in **youtube-notetaker**, malformed numeric token parsing in **cron-doctor**, and the misplaced Hive helper import in **monte-carlo-push-ingestion**.
- Updated catalog generation so explicit product/business skill frontmatter is kept in the business catalog lane instead of being misclassified as security because of generic risk wording.
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin mirrors, catalog data, plugin compatibility metadata, public docs, sitemap, `llms.txt`, package description, and README counters for the 1,894+ skill catalog.

## Validation

- Verified and merged PR #767, PR #768, and PR #769 after required GitHub checks passed.
- Ran `npm run sync:repo-state`.
- Ran `npm run security:docs`.
- Ran `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/aas-npm-cache npm audit --json` with 0 vulnerabilities.
- Ran `npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/aas-npm-cache npm run test`.
- Ran `node tools/scripts/tests/build_catalog_bundles.test.js`.
- Ran `npm run app:test`.
- Ran `npm run app:build`.
- Ran `cd apps/web-app && npm run verify:seo`.

## [13.6.1] - 2026-07-01 - "LLMS SEO Metadata Refresh"

> Patch release for hosted catalog SEO metadata after the 1,891+ skill refresh.

## Fixed

## [13.5.0] - 2026-06-29 - "Release Readiness, Weaviate, and Browser Runtime Gates"

> Community skill intake and curated-source release for the 1,700+ skill catalog.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Browse skills: [README.md#browse-1700-skills](README.md#browse-1700-skills)
- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This release packages the June 29 maintainer batch: one community PR, six curated external skill imports, source-credit updates, generated registry and plugin mirror sync, and public count refresh for the 1,700+ skill catalog.

## Added

- Added **re-create**, a controlled erasure and rebuild protocol for cases where a file or module must be rewritten from scratch after explicitly preserving public interfaces, working behavior, and blast-radius knowledge (PR #760).
- Added **pre-release-review** from [chaunsin/agent-skills](https://github.com/chaunsin/agent-skills), a read-only production release-readiness audit for migrations, config, secrets, deploy ordering, rollback risk, and launch blockers.
- Added **drizzle-migration-conflict** from [chaunsin/agent-skills](https://github.com/chaunsin/agent-skills), a focused Drizzle Kit migration-conflict diagnosis, repair, and prevention workflow with references and a database-free helper script.
- Added **weaviate** from [weaviate/agent-skills](https://github.com/weaviate/agent-skills), an official Weaviate operations skill for collection inspection, semantic/hybrid/keyword search, data imports, and query-agent workflows.
- Added **weaviate-cookbooks** from [weaviate/agent-skills](https://github.com/weaviate/agent-skills), an official cookbook index for Weaviate RAG, agentic RAG, multimodal PDF search, data explorer, chatbot, frontend, and async-client blueprints.
- Added **frontend-lighthouse** from [stareezy-1/frontend-architecture-skill](https://github.com/stareezy-1/frontend-architecture-skill), a portable Lighthouse CI performance gate for Core Web Vitals budgets, category floors, median runs, and CI artifacts.
- Added **browser-testing-with-devtools** from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills), a Chrome DevTools MCP browser-verification skill for live DOM, console, network, screenshot, accessibility, and performance evidence.

## Changed

- Added README source credits for `chaunsin/agent-skills`, `weaviate/agent-skills`, `stareezy-1/frontend-architecture-skill`, and `addyosmani/agent-skills`.
- Normalized imported skill metadata with repository categories, risk labels, source provenance, dates, authors, tags, tools, license fields, `When to Use` sections, and explicit `Limitations`.
- Rewrote Weaviate cookbook install snippets that piped remote install scripts into a shell so the docs-security check keeps download, inspection, and execution as separate steps.
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin mirrors, catalog data, plugin compatibility metadata, package description, README counters, and public docs for the 1,700+ skill catalog.

## Validation

- Verified PR #760 checks for source validation, artifact preview, review, CodeQL, Dependency Review, Socket, Snyk, and PR policy before merging.
- Ran `npm run validate`.
- Ran `npm run security:docs` after normalizing the imported Weaviate install snippets.
- Ran `npm run check:warning-budget`.
- Ran `npm run chain`, including validation, plugin compatibility sync, index generation, bundle sync, and metadata sync.
- Ran `npm run catalog`.

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Browse skills: [README.md#browse-1693-skills](README.md#browse-1693-skills)
- Hosted catalog: https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/

This release packages the June 27 maintainer batch: four community skill PRs, source-credit fixes for imported MIT-licensed community repositories, generated registry and plugin mirror sync, and public count refresh for the 1,693+ skill catalog.

## Added

- Added **web-project-brainstorming**, a project-scoping skill for web concepts, UX flows, responsive layouts, design-system direction, technical architecture, SEO, and MVP planning (PR #756).
- Added **cron-doctor** from [takeaseatventure/devops-skills](https://github.com/takeaseatventure/devops-skills), a cron expression diagnosis skill with a bundled zero-dependency parser, validator, CLI, and trap checklist for silent schedule failures (PR #757).

- Added **ai-loop**, a bounded spec-build-review workflow skill for scoped development loops with explicit verification evidence, iteration budgets, and human approval gates (PR #759).

## Changed

- Added README source credits for the `takeaseatventure/devops-skills` and `takeaseatventure/sql-sentinel` community repositories.
- Hardened the **ai-loop** contribution during maintainer review so it describes bounded, approval-gated workflows rather than unqualified autonomous execution.
- Normalized the **sql-sentinel** limitations heading to the repository's canonical quality gate.
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin mirrors, catalog data, contributor/source metadata, sitemap, package description, and public docs for the 1,693+ skill catalog.

## Validation

- Verified PR checks for source validation, skill review, artifact preview, CodeQL, Dependency Review, Socket, Snyk, and PR policy before merging PRs #756, #757, #758, and #759.
- Ran `npm run check:readme-credits -- --base origin/main --head HEAD` on the source-credit fixes for `cron-doctor` and `sql-sentinel`.
- Ran the focused audit-skills test after normalizing `sql-sentinel` limitations: `node tools/scripts/run-python.js tools/scripts/tests/test_audit_skills.py`.
- Ran `npm run validate` after the maintainer edits.
- Ran `npm run sync:repo-state`, including validation, plugin compatibility sync, index/catalog generation, web asset sync, contributor sync, consistency audit, and warning-budget enforcement.

- Added **gh-image** from [drogers0/gh-image](https://github.com/drogers0/gh-image), a GitHub CLI image-upload skill for producing canonical `user-attachments` URLs for PRs, issues, comments, and README screenshots (PR #753).

## Changed

- Normalized Windows path-separator expectations in installer manifest tests (PR #751).
- Updated the Loki generated frontend example to React 19.2.7 and React DOM 19.2.7, combining the Snyk upgrade intent from PRs #754 and #755 into a maintainer patch because those PRs directly touched generated example files.
- Refreshed generated registry artifacts, plugin mirrors, catalog data, contributor/source metadata, sitemap, package description, and public docs for the 1,689+ skill catalog.

## Validation

- Verified PR checks for source validation, skill review, artifact preview, CodeQL, Dependency Review, Socket, and Snyk before merging the community skill PRs.

## Changed

- Updated runtime and example dependencies from the Snyk maintenance batch: `yaml`, Loki example `better-sqlite3`, `cors`, and `express-rate-limit`.
- Merged the web-app Snyk dependency batch: `@supabase/supabase-js` 2.107.0 (PR #738), `framer-motion` 12.40.0 (PR #739), `tailwind-merge` 3.6.0 (PR #740), `react-virtuoso` 4.18.7 (PR #741), and React 19.2.7 with React DOM aligned to 19.2.7 (PR #742 plus maintainer fix).
- Reverted **surgical-fix** after maintainer review found it overlapped existing debugging protocol skills; the useful ideas should land as focused improvements to existing skills instead of a duplicate standalone skill (PR #732).

## [13.0.0] - 2026-06-20 - "Specialized Plugins and Security Metadata"

> Major installable plugin update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README.md#best-skills-by-tool](README.md#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md)
- Specialized plugin roadmap: [docs/users/specialized-plugin-roadmap.md](docs/users/specialized-plugin-roadmap.md)

This release packages the June 20 plugin and security-maintenance batch: expanded specialized plugin coverage, seven new bundle plugins built only from existing repository skills, installability metadata for higher-risk skills, CodeQL and CSV security fixes, generated registry sync, and release metadata for the 1,678+ skill catalog.

## Breaking / Installability Changes

- Reclassified high-risk skills including **android-cli**, **apple-notes-search**, **atlas-contract**, **atlas-ledger**, **codex-fable5**, **dos-verify-done-claims**, **macos-screen-recorder**, and **screenstudio-alt** so generated plugin mirrors no longer expose them as safe default installs.
- Removed newly-blocked high-risk skills from the general Codex and Claude plugin mirrors while keeping their canonical source skills in `skills/`.
- Added explicit plugin setup metadata for manual-only skills that require pinned third-party tools, host permissions, or local system access.

## New Specialized Plugin Bundles

- **AAS Accessibility & Inclusive UX** - accessibility audit, screen-reader testing, UI a11y, Playwright, and webapp testing workflows.
- **AAS API Platform Builder** - API design, documentation, auth patterns, OpenAPI, load testing, observability, and backend architecture workflows.
- **AAS AI Product & Evaluation Ops** - agent evaluation, LLM app patterns, analytics, KPI dashboards, Langfuse, A/B tests, and product-management workflows.
- **AAS Data Engineering Platform** - Airflow, dbt, data engineering, database architecture, Postgres best practices, SQL, RAG, embeddings, and vector database workflows.
- **AAS Localization & International Growth** - i18n, hreflang, SEO content, schema markup, analytics, copywriting, and market-research workflows.
- **AAS Privacy & Compliance Engineering** - GDPR, PCI, FSI compliance, privacy-by-design, security audit, and spec-to-code compliance workflows.
- **AAS SaaS Launch & Revenue** - launch strategy, pricing, monetization, referrals, Stripe, email sequences, SEO audit, and SaaS MVP workflows.

## Plugin Bundle Expansion

- Expanded existing AAS bundles with additional existing skills, including prompt engineering, n8n expressions, Zapier/Make patterns, analytics-product, business-analyst, DevOps troubleshooting, Google Docs automation, SEO content planning, multi-platform app workflows, Claude monitoring, UI review, OpenAPI generation, Pydantic models, screen-reader testing, broken-authentication review, Django access review, web security testing, and UI accessibility.
- Updated generated Codex and Claude plugin manifests with richer positioning, recommended audience, exclusions, rationale, and default prompt metadata.
- Refreshed marketplace data and user-facing bundle docs so specialized plugin candidates now reflect 22 evaluated installable bundles.

## Security Fixes

- Hardened **youtube-notetaker** local artifact server path handling, media serving, content-type handling, and write behavior; PATCH writes are disabled by default unless a write token is explicitly configured.
- Hardened **competitor-analysis** HTML stripping to avoid script/style regex bypasses and entity-decoding order issues.
- Replaced mutable or unsafe install guidance in **android-cli**, **apple-notes-search**, **codex-fable5**, and **dos-verify-done-claims** with reviewable, pinned, or manually confirmed setup flows.
- Added prompt-injection guardrails for **loop-library** live prompt-catalog usage and Atlas workspace documents.
- Redacted sensitive Android UI journey logging examples and avoided storing password/token/OTP/payment input values in journey logs.
- Bound ECL harness database service examples to localhost and removed destructive volume deletion from teardown guidance.
- Replaced predictable `/tmp` paths in cleanup/build examples with `mktemp`-based temporary paths.
- Added payment/privacy guardrails to **event-staffing-ordering**.
- Updated Mailtrap and screen-recording related risk labels to avoid safe-install misclassification.

## Maintainer Tooling

- Fixed drift detection normalization so `author:` and `date_added:` are ignored only inside YAML frontmatter, not in meaningful skill body content.
- Added regression coverage for body-level drift detection.
- Clarified **2slides-ppt-generator** dependency setup and removed scanner-triggering API-key placeholder examples.
- Refreshed `apps/web-app/public/social-card.svg` so catalog-count metadata matches the current release surface.

## Maintainer Sync

- Synced generated registry artifacts, plugin mirrors, bundle manifests, web catalog data, README release metadata, specialized plugin roadmap, and marketplace surfaces for the 1,678+ skill catalog.
- Added the repo-local `AGENTS.md` contributor/agent guidance file to the release.
- Verified the release path with validation, generated bundle checks, plugin-compatibility checks, docs security tests, repository tests, targeted self-tests, and whitespace checks.

This release packages the June 16 maintainer batch: three accepted community PRs, the CrossFrame skill suite, workflow heading fixes, generated registry sync, and the hosted catalog refreshed to 1,569+ skills.

## New Skills

- **youtube-seo-optimizer** - YouTube and podcast SEO workflow for keyword research, metadata generation, transcript repurposing, and content optimization.
- **brave-man** - project-specification interview workflow that slows down vague build requests and turns clarified requirements into an implementation prompt.
- **crossframe** and companion skills - Chinese-canonical structural diagnosis, dialogue, essay, debate, teaching, review, notebook, public-issue, organization, and casebook workflows.

## Fixes

- Fixed **ab-test-setup** heading levels so workflow phases 3-8 render as peers instead of nesting under Pre-Requisites.
- Fixed **apify-actorization** step numbering after schema configuration by renumbering local testing and deployment to Steps 7 and 8.
- Refreshed `llms.txt` SEO metadata so Pages verification matches the current 1,569+ skill catalog.

## Improvements

- Synced generated registry artifacts, plugin mirrors, web catalog assets, sitemap, and release metadata for the 1,569+ skill catalog.
- Approved and re-ran maintainer-required fork checks for remaining community PRs, leaving PR #691 open until its PR body and Quality Bar Checklist are completed.

## [12.3.0] - 2026-06-10 - "Android, Unship, 40K Stars, and Security Hardening"

> Community release for the June 10 maintainer batch, installer hardening, and the repository crossing 40K GitHub stars.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README.md#best-skills-by-tool](README.md#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](docs/users/workflows.md)

This release accepts the validated June 10 community PRs, refreshes the catalog with Android and shipping workflows, and celebrates the repository passing **40,000 GitHub stars**. At release time the live repository count was 40,206 stars.

## New Skills

- **android-dev** - end-to-end Android development workflow guidance, including project setup, build/debug loops, testing, release preparation, and production quality checks.
- **unship** - product and codebase teardown workflow for deprecating features, removing dead paths, and shipping safer cleanup plans.

## Security

- Hardened the installer so nested skill installs refuse symlinked intermediate destination directories instead of copying outside the selected install root.
- Added regression coverage proving Antigravity installs cannot escape through pre-existing target-path symlinks.
- Tightened `accesslint-diff` branch-switching guidance so branch names stay quoted, option-like names are rejected, and the branch ref must resolve before `git switch`.
- Removed unsupported `2slides-ppt-generator` narration flags from root and plugin docs, aligning examples with the actual script interface.

## Improvements

- Updated `event-staffing-ordering` to remove the stale `request_quote` action from implementation references.
- Synced the accepted PR batch on `main`; PR #642 remains open because it is still conflicting and targets non-canonical generated paths.

## Credits

- **[@kissmyabs32](https://github.com/kissmyabs32)** for PR #666 (`event-staffing-ordering` cleanup).
- **[@mbenhard](https://github.com/mbenhard)** and **[mbenhard/unship](https://github.com/mbenhard/unship)** for PR #663 (`unship`).

> Patch release for the June 7 security scan remediation after `12.2.0`.

## Security

- Hardened `user-thoughts` runtime file handling against symlink traversal and realpath escapes inside `.ustht/`.
- Fixed tar archive validation to prefer PAX `path` / `linkpath` headers before GNU long-name headers.
- Replaced risky documentation examples for unquoted Git branches, placeholder `git add`, predictable `/tmp` installer paths, token-printing Vercel commands, and unsafe JSON-LD injection.
- Removed public Google and Bing site-verification tokens from the web app.
- Raised risk labels and plugin metadata for external-code and remote-execution skills, including `runapi-cli`, `open-dynamic-workflows`, and `polis-protocol`.

## Improvements

- Marked `2slides-ppt-generator` plugin setup as manual with declared Python requirements.
- Fixed broken plugin bundle links and the mobile plugin skill list.
- Regenerated plugin compatibility reports, skill indexes, web assets, and plugin mirrors after the remediation.

## [11.6.0] - 2026-05-23 - "Audit Hardening and Karpathy Guidelines"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills --help`
- Choose your tool: [README.md#choose-your-tool](README.md#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README.md#best-skills-by-tool](README.md#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](docs/users/workflows.md)

This release hardens the repository after a full audit pass, fixes issue #611 by syncing `andrej-karpathy` to English upstream guidelines, and improves release/security guardrails.

## Security

- Replaced executable pipe-to-shell install examples across canonical skills with package-manager or download-inspect-execute flows, and removed the obsolete allowlist comments.
- Hardened the web-app refresh archive fallback by pre-validating tar/zip paths, rejecting archive symlink entries, and verifying extracted real paths before moving downloaded skills into place.
- Replaced the Telegram Node boilerplate and docs examples with Telegraf to remove the deprecated vulnerable `request` dependency chain and avoid putting bot tokens in webhook URLs.
- Hardened WhatsApp webhook signature validation so malformed `x-hub-signature-256` headers return `401` instead of throwing on `timingSafeEqual` buffer length mismatches.
- Refused installer migrations through symlinked target directories and added regression coverage for symlink target failures.
- Restored TLS verification by default in Junta scraper implementations, with insecure TLS only available through the shared `JUNTA_INSECURE_TLS` escape hatch.

## Fixed

- Replaced the non-English `andrej-karpathy` skill content with English Karpathy coding guidelines synced from the upstream `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills` source.
- Made `audit:skills:strict` enforce an explicit legacy warning budget so strict skill-audit debt is tracked and regressions fail without blocking on the historical backlog.
- Replaced realistic AWS/private-key examples with unmistakable placeholders and taught `security:docs` to block those patterns from returning.
- Rebuilt local documentation link validation as a deterministic, path-aware checker for `README.md`, `docs/`, and `docs_zh-CN/`, and repaired the broken localized/internal markdown links it now catches.
- Refreshed stale Chinese documentation release/count claims to `11.5.0` / `1,465+` and marked the old final validation report as a historical snapshot.
- Made the Chinese glossary validation report deterministic by removing timestamps and machine-specific absolute paths.
- Stopped publishing `.disabled` skills as web static assets during `app:setup`.
- Updated web-app SEO counts and social metadata to `1,465+`, aligned the SEO verifier and Pages workflow with the linked `site.webmanifest`, and corrected the documented canonical URL environment variables.
- Added generated-index duplicate-ID protection so future nested skill basename collisions fail during index generation.
- Fixed the Remotion chart rule typo from `implmentation` to `implementation`.

## [11.5.0] - 2026-05-21 - "Security Boundary Hardening and New Agent Skills"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

This release hardens plugin-safe distribution boundaries, resolves the current Dependabot `ws` alert in the web app lockfile, and merges PR #604 and PR #605 through the maintainer workflow.

## New Skills

- **subagent-orchestrator** - quota-aware parallel subagent coordination for large, multi-file Antigravity tasks.
- **bilig-workpaper** - formula-backed WorkPaper JSON and MCP guidance for deterministic spreadsheet-style agent workflows.

## Security

- **plugin-safe boundary hardening** - blocks critical-risk or third-party setup-sensitive community skills from the generated Codex and Claude plugin-safe distributions.
- **ingest-youtube input hardening** - validates single-video YouTube URLs, terminates `yt-dlp` options with `--`, ignores user config, adds subprocess timeouts, and neutralizes untrusted metadata in generated markdown.
- **web app dependency fixes** - updates `ws` to the patched `8.20.1` range and refreshes vulnerable transitive audit entries in `apps/web-app/package-lock.json`.

## Improvements

- **generated artifact sync** - refreshes compatibility data, skill indexes, plugin mirrors, docs, and visible skill counts to `1,464+`.
- **subagent-orchestrator metadata** - normalizes PR #604 metadata so the skill passes repository validation.

## Who should care

- **Plugin users** get a safer marketplace-style distribution that excludes setup-sensitive critical workflows from safe plugin bundles.
- **Vault users** get safer YouTube transcript ingestion with stricter URL and markdown handling.
- **Agent workflow builders** get two new community skills for parallel agent coordination and formula-backed workbook automation.

## [11.4.1] - 2026-05-20 - "Installer Supply-Chain Hardening"

> Patch release for the npm installer used by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

This release hardens the npm installer after reviewing Socket.dev's AI-detected code-anomaly warning for `tools/bin/install.js`.

## Improvements

- **release-pinned installs** - default `npx agentic-awesome-skills` installs now clone the matching package release tag instead of the repository tip, reducing drift between npm package contents and installed skills.
- **git ref validation** - `--tag` and `--version` refs are validated before invoking `git clone`, while still allowing explicit branch installs such as `--tag main`.
- **destination symlink guard** - installer copy operations now refuse to write through pre-existing destination symlinks.
- **installer docs and regression coverage** - documents the release-pinned default and adds installer tests for release-tag resolution and unsafe ref rejection.

## Who should care

- **npm users** get installer behavior that is pinned to the published package version by default.
- **security scanners and maintainers** get a narrower supply-chain surface for the installer path Socket flagged.

## [11.4.0] - 2026-05-20 - "Mercury MCP, Photopea Embeds, and Codex Bundle Names"

This release merges PR #598 and PR #601 through the maintainer workflow, fixes issue #597 by shortening Codex bundle plugin identifiers, and reduces antivirus false-positive risk in the Linux privilege-escalation guidance from issue #600.

## New Skills

- **mercury-mcp** - lookup reference for Mercury MCP tools covering messages, threads, tasks, automations, agent context, and admin-scoped team graph tools.
- **photopea-embedded-editor** - web-app integration guide for embedding Photopea with `photopea.js`, file loading, scripting, exports, layers, text, selections, and template editing patterns.

## Improvements

- **Codex bundle names** - generated Codex bundle plugins now use compact `aasb-*` names while preserving existing repo-local source directories, keeping qualified skill names within the 64-character loader limit.
- **bundle regression tests** - adds coverage that every generated Codex bundle plugin name and `plugin:skill` qualified name stays within the 64-character limit.
- **security skill false-positive reduction** - replaces a pipe-to-shell LinPEAS example with download, inspect, chmod, and explicit execution steps for authorized labs.
- **generated artifact sync** - refreshes catalog, skill index, plugin mirrors, web assets, contributor credits, package metadata, and visible skill counts to `1,462+`.

## Who should care

- **Codex CLI users** can enable editorial bundles without losing valid skills to long qualified plugin names.
- **MCP users** get a compact Mercury tool reference for agent messaging, task tracking, and automations.
- **Web app builders** get a practical Photopea embedding guide for browser-based image editing workflows.

This release closes issue #596 with a stable discovery-manifest contract and merges PR #595 through the maintainer squash-merge workflow. It keeps contributor PRs source-only while making `main` the canonical owner of generated manifests, web assets, and release metadata.

## New Skills

- **recsys-pipeline-architect** - recommendation, ranking, and feed pipeline design using a Source -> Hydrator -> Filter -> Scorer -> Selector -> SideEffect architecture.

## Improvements

- **stable discovery manifest** - keeps root `skills_index.json` as the canonical public manifest, mirrors it exactly to `data/skills_index.json`, and documents lazy-loading usage for downstream tools.
- **manifest schema and docs** - adds `schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json` plus user and integration docs that distinguish the canonical root manifest from the compatibility mirror.
- **CI-safe drift checks** - extends consistency auditing and PR artifact previews so root/data/web-backup manifest drift is visible and enforced on `main`.
- **generated artifact sync** - refreshes catalog, skill index, plugin mirrors, web assets, contributor credits, package metadata, and visible skill counts to `1,460+`.

## Who should care

- **Tool builders and indexers** get a stable manifest contract they can validate and consume without loading every skill up front.
- **Users with large installs** get clearer guidance for filtering by category, risk, source, and description before lazy-loading individual skills.
- **Recommendation-system builders** get a focused skill for designing composable feed and ranking pipelines across TypeScript, Go, Python, and adjacent stacks.

- **security hardening** - pins `production-audit` to `commitshow@0.3.23`, marks it critical because it executes external npm code, adds prompt-injection guardrails to `git-pr-review`, tightens KubeStellar `kc-agent` RBAC guidance, normalizes installer manifest cleanup for flattened `skills/` paths, and updates Loki example backend dependencies to clear the open `ip-address` Dependabot alerts.
- **source provenance and credits** - adds README source coverage for Aomi, Rich Elicitation, and MockHunter, and normalizes the `multi-agent-architect` risk/source metadata before release.
- **generated artifact sync** - refreshes catalog, skill index, plugin mirrors, web assets, package metadata, and visible skill counts to `1,450+`.

## Who should care

- **Agent builders** get new workflows for on-chain execution, multi-agent architecture, and structured clarification.
- **Frontend and product reviewers** get a mock-data audit skill for validating whether live UI values have real backing sources.
- **Game creators** get a Unity-oriented planning skill for turning raw concepts into actionable production and asset-generation plans.
- **Skill authors and maintainers** get the completed `skill-writer` reference workflow and cleaner release metadata.

- **Windows activation reliability** - makes `scripts/activate-skills.bat` safer around helper discovery, Python probing, archive-prefix overrides, and fallback activation behavior.
- **Cross-platform validation consistency** - normalizes path handling in registry and validation utilities so Windows path separators no longer create false negatives in tooling and tests.
- **Windows smoke coverage** - adds dedicated batch-script smoke coverage, including the missing-helper fallback path, and refreshes supporting installer and plugin tests.
- **Skill guidance cleanup** - adds explicit `## When to Use` sections across a large set of `SKILL.md` files so trigger intent is clearer and warning-budget checks stay green.
- **Release hygiene** - keeps contributor PRs source-only while letting `main` own the generated catalog sync after merge.

## Who should care

- **Windows users** get a more reliable activation path and fewer path-related validation surprises.
- **Maintainers** get cleaner contributor PR handling, better smoke coverage, and a release path aligned with the current generated-artifact contract.
- **Anyone browsing skills directly** gets clearer `When to Use` guidance across a much larger portion of the library.

## [9.6.0] - 2026-04-04 - "Psychology and SEO Growth Packs"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release folds the full open PR batch into `main` and centers on two major content expansions for growth teams. It adds an SEO/AEO content engine and a large psychology-driven marketing pack, while also tightening the web-app skill card hover state and pulling in the latest `yaml` patch release so the repository and installer surface stay current.

## New Skills

- **SEO-AEO Engine bundle** - merges PR #446 with 8 skills for keyword research, content clustering, landing pages, long-form blog structure, internal linking, metadata, schema, and SEO/AEO auditing.
- **Psychology skills pack** - merges PR #451 with 20 research-backed skills for profiling, persuasion, pricing psychology, onboarding, pitch strategy, UX persuasion, copywriting, and visual-emotion design.

## Improvements

- **Web app hover stability** - merges PR #449 to keep the home-page `SkillCard` readable on hover with a lighter lift/shadow treatment instead of palette inversion.
- **Dependency refresh** - merges PR #450 to bump `yaml` from `2.8.2` to `2.8.3`.
- **README credit sync** - refreshes contributor and community-source credits on `main` immediately after the merged PR batch, including the upstream `mrprewsh/seo-aeo-engine` source.

## Who should care

- **Growth, SEO, and content teams** get a full pipeline for keyword discovery, cluster planning, structured landing pages, schema, internal linking, and publish-time audits.
- **Marketing and UX teams** get a larger psychology-oriented pack for messaging, pricing, onboarding, social proof, objections, and conversion design.
- **Web-app users** get a cleaner hover treatment on the skill cards in the homepage UI.

## Credits

- **[@prewsh](https://github.com/prewsh)** and **[mrprewsh/seo-aeo-engine](https://github.com/mrprewsh/seo-aeo-engine)** for the SEO/AEO skill bundle merged in PR #446

## [9.5.1] - 2026-04-03 - "npm Runtime Dependency Fix"

> **Patch release to restore `npx agentic-awesome-skills` installs after the published CLI started failing to resolve `yaml` at runtime**

This release fixes a packaging regression in `9.5.0`. The installer entrypoint loads `tools/lib/skill-utils.js`, which depends on `yaml`, but the published npm package declared that module only as a development dependency. In clean `npx` environments this caused the installer to crash immediately with `Error: Cannot find module 'yaml'`, as reported in issue `#445`.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — `9.5.1` is a focused patch release for the published npm installer.

## Improvements

- **Runtime dependency fix**: moved `yaml` from `devDependencies` to runtime `dependencies` so the published CLI bundle installs everything required by `tools/bin/install.js` and `tools/lib/skill-utils.js`.
- **Packaging regression coverage**: extended the npm package contents test to assert that `yaml` remains declared as a runtime dependency for the installer contract.
- **Installer verification**: re-ran the package dry-run and installer-focused tests to confirm the published artifact and filtered install flow no longer reproduce the missing-module failure from issue `#445`.

## Credits

- **Issue #445 reporter** for isolating the `yaml` packaging regression in the published npm CLI artifact.

## [9.5.0] - 2026-04-03 - "Selective Installs and 30K Stars"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, and related AI coding assistants.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release expands the library with four practical additions while making installs much more manageable for context-sensitive runtimes. It merges the current open PR batch, adds `humanize-chinese` directly on `main`, introduces first-class installer filtering by `risk`, `category`, and `tags`, and updates the docs so OpenCode-style `.agents/skills` setups start from a reduced install instead of overwhelming the runtime. It also marks a project milestone: the repository crossed **30K GitHub stars** on April 3, 2026. Thank you to every contributor, source project, issue reporter, and user who keeps this library useful.

## New Skills

- **agentflow** - merges PR #438 to add Kanban-style multi-worker orchestration guidance for Claude Code development pipelines.
- **uxui-principles** - merges PR #441 to add research-backed UX/UI audit guidance sourced from the `uxuiprinciples/agent-skills` collection.
- **agentphone** - merges PR #442 to add phone-agent workflows for voice calls, SMS operations, number management, and streaming telephony flows.
- **humanize-chinese** - adds issue-driven coverage for Chinese AI-text detection, rewriting, academic AIGC reduction, and style-conversion workflows based on `voidborne-d/humanize-chinese`.

## Improvements

- **Selective installer filters** - the npm installer now supports `--risk <csv>`, `--category <csv>`, and `--tags <csv>` with comma-separated include values, trailing `-` exclusions, OR semantics within each flag, exclusion precedence, and AND semantics across dimensions.
- **Tag-aware filtering** - installer filtering now reads skill frontmatter directly so `tags` can participate in install selection even though `skills_index.json` does not store them.
- **Recursive install sync** - install manifests now track nested skill paths consistently, and filtered updates prune stale managed entries instead of leaving old skills behind.
- **OpenCode guidance** - `README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, and `docs/users/faq.md` now explicitly recommend reduced installs for `.agents/skills` hosts and document the new filter grammar.
- **Source and contributor credits** - post-merge README credit sync now includes the upstream repositories reflected in this release batch, including `UrRhb/agentflow`, `AgentPhone-AI/skills`, `uxuiprinciples/agent-skills`, and `voidborne-d/humanize-chinese`.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI users** get four new skills covering workflow orchestration, UX/UI review, telephony agents, and Chinese text humanization.
- **OpenCode and other `.agents/skills` users** now have a supported reduced-install path instead of needing the full library in a context-sensitive runtime.
- **Maintainers and teams curating smaller agent surfaces** can now ship filtered installs by risk, category, and tag without manually pruning skill folders after each update.

- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release focuses on repository reliability rather than adding new skills. It hardens marketplace and plugin validation, adds stronger release-facing CI checks, refreshes the root README and source-credit ledger, and cleans up several maintainer and user docs so the public repo matches the active merge and release workflow on `main`.

## Improvements

- **Marketplace sync reliability** - made editorial bundle and plugin publication sync more atomic so generated marketplace state is staged and refreshed more predictably during maintainer flows.
- **Validation hardening** - tightened frontmatter parsing, plugin compatibility checks, and bundle/index validation to better defend against malformed or unsafe metadata.
- **Release CI guardrails** - added dedicated dependency-review and actionlint workflows, plus the corresponding shellcheck-safe workflow fix in CI.
- **README landing-page cleanup** - reorganized the root `README.md` so discovery, installation, and credits are easier to scan, and removed misplaced SEO wording.
- **Source credits refresh** - audited the credits ledger against current upstream sources and release history, removed the dead `sstklen/claude-api-cost-optimization` entry, normalized stale descriptions, and added missing official/community repos now reflected in the README.
- **Maintainer merge policy** - updated `.github/MAINTENANCE.md` so every PR merge now explicitly requires checking and syncing both `### Community Contributors` and `## Repo Contributors`.
- **English documentation cleanup** - translated remaining mixed Italian phrasing in maintainer audit docs, workflow docs, and the Jetski Cortex integration guide to keep repository-facing documentation consistent.

## Changed

- **Generated repo state** - refreshed the sitemap, star-history asset, and metadata-driven README state as part of the current `main` sync flow.
- **Vietnamese credits mirror** - aligned the Vietnamese README copy with the current source-credit corrections that landed on the main README.
- **Release-facing tests** - updated consistency and metadata tests to match the refreshed README/docs wording and current release contract.

## Who should care

- **Maintainers** get a safer release path with stricter validation, clearer post-merge credit rules, and stronger CI checks before tags are cut.
- **Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity users** get a cleaner root README and more accurate source attribution when discovering official and community skill collections.
- **Contributors and documentation-heavy users** get more consistent English-language docs across workflows, maintainer guidance, and integration references.

## Credits

- **Repository maintainers** for the post-`9.3.0` release hardening, CI additions, documentation cleanup, and source-credit audit on `main`

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release makes the repository much easier to use for Chinese-speaking developers while tightening contributor docs and expanding community-skill discovery. It ships the full `docs_zh-CN` translation batch, folds in a markdown fence fix for contributor documentation, strengthens `github-issue-creator` discoverability metadata, and carries forward the recent `SoulPass` community listing on `main`.

## New

- **Chinese documentation set** - merged PR #423 with a full Simplified Chinese translation pass across user, contributor, maintainer, and integration docs under `docs_zh-CN`, plus glossary and validation assets.

## Improvements

- **Contributor docs formatting** - merged PR #418 to correct nested fenced-code examples in `docs/contributors/skill-anatomy.md`, making the markdown examples render correctly for contributors.
- **Community discovery** - current `main` includes the `SoulPass` Community Contributed Skills listing requested in issue #421, keeping Solana wallet, trading, and agent-identity workflows easy to discover.
- **Issue triage cleanup** - improved `github-issue-creator` metadata and usage guidance so external discovery tools can classify and recommend it more accurately.

## Who should care

## [9.0.0] - 2026-03-27 - "Claude Code and Codex Plugin Release"

> Full release for the installable skill library, now with first-class plugin distributions for Claude Code and Codex plus the normal GitHub Release publication flow.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- Plugin explainer: [docs/users/plugins.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/plugins.md)
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release makes the new plugin distribution model a user-facing feature. Claude Code now has a formal root marketplace plugin plus generated bundle plugins, and Codex now ships the equivalent repo-local root plugin plus generated bundle plugins. The release also consolidates plugin documentation into a canonical user guide, aligns onboarding docs around the difference between the full repository and the plugin-safe subset, and packages the latest merge batch on `main`.

## New

- **Claude Code plugin distribution** - formalized the root `.claude-plugin` marketplace entry plus generated bundle plugins as a first-class install path.
- **Codex plugin distribution** - formalized the root Codex plugin metadata in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and `plugins/agentic-awesome-skills/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, alongside generated bundle plugins.
- **Canonical plugin documentation** - added `docs/users/plugins.md` to explain plugin-safe filtering, root plugin vs bundle plugins, and when to prefer plugins over the full library install.
- **akf-trust-metadata** - merged PR #406, adding the new `akf-trust-metadata` skill to the repository.

## Improvements

- **Onboarding alignment** - updated `README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, `docs/users/faq.md`, `docs/users/claude-code-skills.md`, `docs/users/codex-cli-skills.md`, `docs/users/bundles.md`, and `docs/users/usage.md` so the plugin story is explained consistently.
- **Community discovery** - merged PR #407 to add the CoinPaprika & DexPaprika listing to the community-contributed section of the README.
- **Maintainer release batch** - merged both open PRs through the documented GitHub squash flow, then packaged the resulting `main` branch as a full release instead of a tag-only cut.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code users** now have a cleaner choice between full-library install, root marketplace plugin, and smaller bundle plugins.
- **Codex users** now get the same plugin distribution model instead of relying only on direct `.codex/skills/` installs.
- **Maintainers and team leads** can onboard people with plugin-safe starter surfaces while keeping the full repository as the broader source of truth.

## Credits

- **[@CryptoDoppio](https://github.com/CryptoDoppio)** for the new `akf-trust-metadata` skill in PR #406

This release combines a curated import from `Dimillian/Skills` with two merged community pull requests on `main`. It expands Apple-platform workflows, GitHub/refactor guidance, and SwiftUI performance coverage, adds a new Snowflake engineering skill, updates WordPress skills for 7.0, and refreshes the registry/docs surface to `1,326+` indexed skills.

## New Skills

- **app-store-changelog** - turn git history into concise, user-facing App Store release notes.
- **github** - use the `gh` CLI for pull requests, issues, workflow runs, and GitHub API queries.
- **ios-debugger-agent** - debug iOS apps on booted simulators with XcodeBuildMCP.
- **macos-menubar-tuist-app** - build and maintain SwiftUI macOS menubar apps with Tuist-first workflows.
- **macos-spm-app-packaging** - scaffold and package SwiftPM macOS apps without Xcode projects.
- **orchestrate-batch-refactor** - plan large refactors with dependency-aware work packets and parallel analysis.
- **project-skill-audit** - audit a project and recommend the highest-value skills to add or update.
- **react-component-performance** - diagnose slow React components and apply targeted performance fixes.
- **simplify-code** - review diffs for clarity and safe simplifications.
- **snowflake-development** - Snowflake SQL, pipelines, Cortex AI, Snowpark, performance, and security guidance (PR #395).
- **swift-concurrency-expert** - fix actor isolation, `Sendable`, and Swift concurrency issues.
- **swiftui-liquid-glass** - implement and review SwiftUI Liquid Glass APIs correctly.
- **swiftui-performance-audit** - audit SwiftUI runtime performance from code and profiling evidence.
- **swiftui-ui-patterns** - apply proven SwiftUI patterns for navigation, sheets, and async state.
- **swiftui-view-refactor** - refactor SwiftUI views into smaller components with explicit data flow.

## Improvements

- **WordPress 7.0 coverage**: merged PR #394 to expand `wordpress`, `wordpress-plugin-development`, `wordpress-theme-development`, `wordpress-woocommerce-development`, and `wordpress-penetration-testing` with WordPress 7.0 collaboration, AI, admin, and security guidance.
- **Maintainer PR flow**: brought both open PRs into compliance with the source-only policy and PR template requirements before merging them via GitHub squash merge.
- **Registry sync**: refreshed README/catalog metadata, contributor sync, and count-sensitive docs so `main` now reflects `1,326+` indexed skills.
- **Warning-budget preservation**: normalized imported and newly merged skills so the repository remains within the frozen validation budget at `135/135`.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code and Codex CLI users** get a larger set of high-signal workflow skills for GitHub, refactoring, project audits, and Swift/SwiftUI maintenance.
- **Apple-platform developers** get a meaningful jump in coverage across iOS debugging, Swift concurrency, SwiftUI architecture, Liquid Glass, performance, and macOS packaging/menubar patterns.
- **Data and platform engineers** get a new `snowflake-development` skill plus richer WordPress 7.0 documentation for modern content/admin workflows.

## [8.7.1] - 2026-03-23 - "Release Pipeline Repair"

> Patch release to restore npm publication after the `v8.7.0` GitHub Release failed before reaching the npm registry.

Start here:

- Install: `npx agentic-awesome-skills`
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This patch release keeps the `8.7.0` skill/library content intact and fixes the release pipeline so npm publication works end-to-end again. The root cause was that the publish workflow only installed root dependencies before building `apps/web-app`, leaving the web app without its own `node_modules` in CI.

## Improvements

- **npm publish repair**: Updated the publish workflow to install `apps/web-app` dependencies before the web build, matching the working GitHub Pages workflow and preventing the missing-React/missing-Vite TypeScript cascade seen in CI.
- **Release verification hardening**: Added deterministic web-app installation to the maintainer release suite so `release:preflight` and `release:prepare` now catch this class of failure before a GitHub Release is published.
- **Deterministic installs**: Switched the shared `app:install` script to `npm ci` so local and CI web-app installs use the same locked dependency graph.

## Who should care

- **Maintainers** can cut releases again without the publish workflow failing during the web-app build.
- **npm users** can finally receive the `8.7.x` catalog and skill updates through the package registry instead of being stuck on `8.4.0`.
- **Web-app contributors** get a cleaner release contract where CI explicitly prepares the frontend before building it.

## [8.7.0] - 2026-03-23 - "Reference Recovery and Release Reliability"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release packages the maintainer sweep after `v8.6.0`: restored missing C++ reference material, added three new community skills plus the maintainer-integrated `jobgpt` skill, and fixed the Jetski lazy-loader example so release validation no longer fails on a raw TypeScript import.

## New Skills

- **moyu** - anti-over-engineering guardrails for AI coding agents that need to stay narrowly scoped and prefer the smallest viable change (PR #384)
- **windows-shell-reliability** - practical Windows PowerShell and CMD guidance for encoding, quoting, logging, and detached process launches (PR #386)
- **jobgpt** - JobGPT MCP integration for job search automation, resume generation, application tracking, salary insights, and recruiter outreach (local maintainer integration from PR #388)

## Improvements

- **cpp-pro restoration**: Restored the missing `cpp-pro` nested reference guides and implementation playbook so the skill's documented deep links work again (PR #383, issue #382).
- **Release reliability**: Converted the Jetski Gemini loader example from `loader.ts` to a directly importable `loader.mjs`, updated repo references, and restored green local test coverage for the release pipeline.
- **Registry sync**: Refreshed `README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, `data/catalog.json`, `data/bundles.json`, contributors, and tracked web assets so `main` now reflects `1,309+` indexed skills.
- **Metadata hardening**: Brought the merged `moyu` skill back within the frozen validation warning budget by adding explicit metadata and a `When to Use` section.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code and Cursor users** get four new or newly repaired skills, including scope-control guidance, better Windows shell reliability tips, and restored `cpp-pro` deep-dive references.
- **Codex CLI and Gemini CLI users** benefit from the same skill additions plus a working Jetski lazy-loader example that can now be imported directly in Node-based host setups.
- **Maintainers** get a release path that is green again end-to-end, with generated registry artifacts and contributor data re-synced on `main`.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release packages the maintainer sweep after `v8.5.0`: the new `gdb-cli` community skill, removal of the stale in-repo `goldrush-api` copy, and a cross-platform recovery path for Antigravity users who hit truncation or context overload with too many active skills.

## New Skills

- **gdb-cli** - AI-assisted GDB debugging for core dumps, live process attach, crash triage, and deadlock analysis with source correlation (PR #375, closes #374)

## Improvements

- **Antigravity overload recovery**: Added `scripts/activate-skills.sh`, a matching installer hint, and new cross-platform user docs so Linux/macOS users can archive the full library and activate only the bundles or skill ids they need in the live Antigravity directory (issue #381).
- **Windows/Linux/macOS troubleshooting**: Expanded the recovery guidance with a shared overload guide plus clearer README, FAQ, and getting-started links for truncation and context-limit failures.
- **Registry cleanup**: Removed the stale in-repo `goldrush-api` mirror, regenerated bundle/catalog artifacts, and refreshed tracked web assets so canonical references no longer point at deleted content (PR #379).
- **Maintainer sync**: Refreshed `README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, `data/catalog.json`, `data/bundles.json`, contributors, and sitemap output after the PR merge batch so `main` stays release-ready.

## Who should care

- **Antigravity users** get a new activation flow for large repositories and a clearer recovery path when too many active skills trigger truncation-style failures.
- **Claude Code and Cursor users** benefit from the new `gdb-cli` skill for C/C++ debugging and the cleaned-up catalog/docs surfaces.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release captures everything that landed after `v8.4.0`: a safety fix for the installer migration path, two new in-repo bdistill skills, broader maintainer automation for metadata/release hygiene, refreshed generated artifacts for the `1,306+` skill catalog, and a new README community section for five OpenClaw skills.

## New Skills

- **bdistill-behavioral-xray** - self-probe an AI model across refusal, reasoning, formatting, grounding, persona, and tool-use dimensions, then generate a visual HTML report (PR #366)
- **bdistill-knowledge-extraction** - extract structured domain knowledge in-session or from local Ollama models into searchable/exportable reference datasets (PR #366)

## Improvements

- **Installer migration safety**: Replaced the destructive legacy migration path in `tools/bin/install.js` with a safety-backup flow so rerunning installs no longer wipes unrelated user skills from the target directory (PR #368, fixes issue #367).
- **Catalog growth and generated sync**: Imported the external marketing, SEO, Obsidian, and Anthropic-adjacent maintainer batch, then refreshed `README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, `data/catalog.json`, bundles, and tracked web assets so `main` now reflects `1,306+` indexed skills.
- **Maintainer automation**: Added docs/package metadata sync, GitHub About sync, contributor sync, release-state sync, repo-state audits, and a frozen validation warning budget so maintainers can keep release artifacts and repo claims aligned with less manual drift.
- **Security and workflow hardening**: Tightened skill tooling file handling, clarified install/PR guidance, and kept CI/release automation aligned with the active source-only PR policy and repo hygiene workflows.
- **Community discovery**: Added a README community section linking five OpenClaw/Claude Code skills from FullStackCrew so users can discover adjacent external tooling from the main repository landing page (PR #370).

## Who should care

This release packages everything that landed after `v8.3.0`: new discovery and SEO surfaces for the catalog, GitHub Pages/web-app reliability fixes, metadata and index curation across the 1,273-skill registry, maintainer release/support polish, and the final merge sweep for PRs #363, #362, and #360.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** - `8.4.0` is a discovery, maintenance, and release-hardening cut rather than a new in-repo skill drop.

## Improvements

- **Catalog discovery and SEO**: Added repo growth discovery pages, finalized the web-app SEO layer for catalog routes, hardened JSON-LD/prerender behavior, expanded the home skills viewport, and improved GitHub Pages/base-path fetch fallbacks so the public catalog is more discoverable and stable.
- **Registry curation**: Expanded curated and uncategorized category coverage, normalized legacy catalog categories, improved safe-skill categorization, and refreshed generated starter packs/bundles to better organize the 1,273-skill library.
- **Metadata quality sweep**: Backfilled missing risk/source metadata, repaired actionable skill descriptions, and merged the `gha-security-review` metadata/usage cleanup so repository validation and review prompts stay more consistent.
- **Infrastructure hardening**: Merged PR #363 to move CI intake to `tools/scripts/pr_preflight.cjs`, localize ESM handling for the Jetski Gemini loader docs, and keep the security/test pipeline green without breaking CommonJS entrypoints.
- **Credits and repo polish**: Added `privacy-mask` to README credits, added the X/community reference update, refreshed the star-history/support surfaces, and kept release-facing onboarding/docs aligned with the current catalog state.

## Who should care

## [8.1.0] - 2026-03-17 - "PR Maintenance and Release Sync"

> **Merged the active PR queue, added three new community skills, repaired metadata drift, and refreshed release-facing docs for the next tagged cut**

This release completes the post-merge maintainer pass for the six open pull requests that landed after `8.0.0`. It adds new skills for progressive web apps, tRPC full-stack development, and external AI code review; repairs malformed YAML frontmatter in legacy skills; fixes a broken `data-scientist` reference; and refreshes README, contributor acknowledgements, and linked onboarding docs before the `v8.1.0` tag.

## New Skills

- **progressive-web-app** — practical PWA implementation guidance for manifests, service workers, caching, offline support, and installability (PR #324)
- **vibers-code-review** — GitHub-based external human review workflow for AI-generated projects, including setup steps and integration guidance (PR #325)
- **trpc-fullstack** — end-to-end type-safe API development patterns with tRPC across server, client, auth, and Next.js integration (PR #329)

## Improvements

- **Docs alignment**: Updated `docs/users/getting-started.md`, README release messaging, and release-facing notes so the public docs reflect the current post-merge state.
- **Issue and reference hygiene**: Removed the dead `resources/implementation-playbook.md` reference from `skills/data-scientist/SKILL.md` (PR #331, closes #327) and closed the duplicate truncation report in issue `#328` against the documented fix path in issue `#269`.
- **FAQ polish**: Aligned FAQ risk-label documentation and added `skill-review` troubleshooting guidance for contributors (PR #330).
- **Legacy metadata repair**: Normalized malformed YAML frontmatter across `astropy`, `biopython`, `cirq`, `citation-management`, `fixing-metadata`, `gmail-automation`, `google-calendar-automation`, `google-docs-automation`, `google-drive-automation`, `google-sheets-automation`, `google-slides-automation`, `networkx`, `qiskit`, `seaborn`, `sympy`, and `varlock` (PR #326).
- **Contributor flow hardening**: Repaired `skills/vibers-code-review/SKILL.md` on the contributor branch so the skill met repository validation rules before merge, then reran CI and merged normally (PR #325 maintainer refresh).

## [8.0.0] - 2026-03-16 - "Community Merge Sweep"

> **Merged eight maintainer-refreshed community PRs, shipped three new skills plus workflow automation improvements, and synced the repository for the next release train**

This release closes the open PR maintenance batch in one pass. It adds new skills for agent-native CLI work, AI-assisted end-to-end testing, and AI engineering workflows; strengthens the review workflow with a dedicated skill-review check; repairs the `analyze-project` skill content; and ships helper scripts plus documentation for resolving activation/context overload issues on local installs.

## New Skills

- **ai-native-cli** — build agent-friendly CLIs with clearer UX, task flows, and distribution guidance (PR #317)
- **awt-e2e-testing** — AI-powered end-to-end testing patterns and beta workflow guidance (PR #320)
- **ai-engineering-toolkit** — AI engineering workflow kit for production-oriented implementation loops (PR #314)

## Improvements

- **PR maintenance batch**: Merged PRs #321, #318, #317, #320, #314, #319, #305, and #322 via GitHub squash merge after maintainer refresh, checklist normalization, and green CI.

## [7.9.2] - 2026-03-15 - "npm CLI Packaging Fix"

> **Patch release to fix the published npm CLI bundle so `npx agentic-awesome-skills` resolves its runtime helper modules correctly**

This release fixes a packaging regression in the published npm artifact. Version `7.9.1` shipped `tools/bin/install.js` without the required `tools/lib` runtime helpers, causing `npx agentic-awesome-skills` to fail with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `../lib/symlink-safety`.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — `7.9.2` is a focused patch release for the npm installer bundle.

## Improvements

- **npm package contents**: Expanded the published `files` whitelist to ship `tools/lib/*` alongside `tools/bin/*`, restoring the runtime dependency required by the installer entrypoint.
- **Regression coverage**: Added a package-contents test that checks `npm pack --dry-run --json` and asserts the published tarball includes both `tools/bin/install.js` and `tools/lib/symlink-safety.js`.
- **CLI verification**: Verified the extracted packaged entrypoint runs successfully with `--help`, confirming the published layout no longer reproduces the missing-module crash reported in issue `#315`.

## Credits

- **Issue #315 reporter** for isolating the npm packaging regression in the published CLI artifact.

## [7.9.1] - 2026-03-15 - "Security Hardening Follow-up"

> **Follow-up release to 7.9.0: same security batch, additional hardening focused on mutating endpoints, markdown rendering, and doc-risk enforcement**

This release is a companion follow-up to `7.9.0` and applies security controls for the web app runtime, runtime refresh endpoint, and documentation quality gates.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — this is a follow-up security maintenance release.

## Improvements

- **Endpoint hardening (mutating API)**: The `/api/refresh-skills` endpoint is now protected by strict local-only ingress rules, explicit token support (`SKILLS_REFRESH_TOKEN` when configured), explicit method validation, and explicit host/Origin checks before any state-changing logic runs.
- **Front-end hardening**: Added POST-only sync from UI and removed unsafe HTML passthrough (`rehype-raw`) from `SkillDetail`, reducing the runtime XSS surface.
- **Documentation risk controls**: Added a full-repo `SKILL.md` security scan for dangerous command patterns (`curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `irm|iex`, obvious command-line token examples), with opt-in comment allowlisting.
- **Security test coverage**: Added dedicated security tests for endpoint authorization/host/token behavior and markdown rendering behavior, and wired docs security checks into the shared test and CI pipeline.
- **Tooling robustness**: Improved YAML date normalization for frontmatter parsing and index generation so unquoted ISO dates remain stable as strings across tooling.

## Credits

- **Internal security hardening pass** covering endpoint, rendering, and docs scanning controls.

## [7.9.0] - 2026-03-15 - "Codex Security Remediation Sweep"

> **Verified and remediated the active security batch on `main`, with triage and fixes delivered thanks to Codex Security with Codex for OSS**

This release is a focused security maintenance cut. We used Codex Security with Codex for OSS as the triage input, verified every reported finding against the current default branch, collapsed duplicates and obsolete reports, then shipped the confirmed fixes in remediation buckets before merging the final set onto `main`.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — `7.9.0` is intentionally a security and maintenance release.

## Improvements

- **Filesystem trust boundaries**: Hardened path, symlink, and archive extraction handling across setup, install, sync, metadata, normalization, indexing, and local dev serving flows.
- **Auth and integrity defaults**: Disabled shared frontend star writes by default unless explicitly enabled, and restored TLS verification defaults in the `junta-leiloeiros` scrapers with an explicit opt-out for insecure targets.
- **Shell safety**: Removed pipe-to-shell and token-on-command-line guidance from the Apify docs, and fixed the audio transcription example so shell values are no longer interpolated directly into Python source.
- **Robustness fixes**: Rejected non-mapping YAML frontmatter in validation paths, moved local state files out of predictable shared `/tmp` locations, repaired malformed metadata, and removed committed Python bytecode artifacts.
- **Regression coverage**: Added focused JS, Python, and web-app tests that prove the remediations and guard the reported root causes from reappearing.
- **Security triage artifacts**: Added maintainer-facing triage outputs at `docs/maintainers/security-findings-triage-2026-03-15.{md,csv}` documenting all 33 findings, including why each one was still valid, duplicate, or obsolete on `HEAD`.

## Credits

- **Codex Security with Codex for OSS** for surfacing and structuring the security batch that drove this release.

## [7.8.0] - 2026-03-14 - "Marketplace & Merge Sweep"

> **Merged seven community PRs, added Claude Code marketplace manifests, and finished the maintainer sync/release pass**

This release closes the active maintenance batch in one pass. It ships a new Claude Code plugin marketplace entrypoint for the whole repository, merges seven open community pull requests after maintainer preflight, removes stale Windows symlink guidance from the user docs, and refreshes the generated registry artifacts on `main` for a single `7.8.0` cut.

## New Skills

- **analyze-project** — root-cause analyst workflow for full-project diagnosis (PR #297)
- **latex-paper-conversion** — convert academic papers into reusable engineering artifacts (PR #296)
- **k6-load-testing** — k6-based API and performance testing guidance (PR #287)
- **tool-use-guardian** — tool-call reliability wrapper with retries, recovery, and failure classification (PR #298)
- **recallmax** — long-context memory, summarization, and conversation compression for agents (PR #298)

## Improvements

- **Claude Code marketplace support**: Added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the repository can be installed as a single Claude Code marketplace plugin (PR #302, closes #288).
- **Windows installer/docs alignment**: Removed the stale `core.symlinks=true` / Developer Mode guidance from user docs after the Windows installer cleanup (PR #299, fixes #286, follow-up #281 closed in release).
- **NotebookLM cleanup**: Removed unused `typing.Optional` / `typing.List` imports from `skills/notebooklm/scripts/browser_utils.py` (PR #301, closes #300).
- **README/source maintenance**: Added maintained attribution for external-sourced skills and merged the `uberSKILLS` README addition without generated-file drift (PRs #298 and #293).
- **Batch merge workflow**: Completed a maintainer preflight for PRs #301, #299, #297, #296, #287, #298, and #293, then regenerated `README.md`, `skills_index.json`, `CATALOG.md`, and `data/*.json` once on `main`.
- **Issue hygiene**: Closed #288, #300, #286, and #281 from the shipped fixes; documented existing support for #294 in the release follow-up.

## [7.7.0] - 2026-03-13 - "Merge Friction Reduction"

> **Shipped four maintained PR outcomes, stabilized generated-file CI, and cut release friction for future contributor merges**

This release turns a noisy maintainer workflow into a predictable one. It merges the latest community skill additions, integrates the cleaned `privacy-by-design` contribution under the maintainer exception path, and removes the biggest source of PR churn by making generated registry drift informational on pull requests while keeping `main` self-healing and strict.

## New Skills

- **llm-structured-output** — structured JSON/schema extraction patterns across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini (PR #280)
- **electron-development** — secure Electron architecture, IPC hardening, packaging, signing, and updates (PR #282)
- **privacy-by-design** — privacy-first software design patterns and implementation guidance (PR #283)
- **antigravity-skill-orchestrator** — meta-skill for selecting and coordinating the best skill set for a task (PR #285)

## Improvements

- **CI determinism**: `tools/scripts/update_readme.py` and `tools/scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py` now preserve volatile README sync metadata during normal runs instead of rewriting stars/timestamps and causing PR drift.
- **PR merge flow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now reports generated registry drift as informational on PRs while keeping `main` strict and auto-syncing the final artifact set after merge.
- **Maintainer docs**: Updated `.github/MAINTENANCE.md`, `docs/maintainers/ci-drift-fix.md`, and `docs/maintainers/merging-prs.md` to document the new lower-friction merge procedure.
- **Windows issue triage**: Clarified that issue `#281` remains open as an installer/symlink problem distinct from truncation-loop issue `#274`, closed `#284` against the shipped recovery guidance, and opened follow-up issue `#286`.

## Credits

- **[@sx4im](https://github.com/sx4im)** for `llm-structured-output` (PR #280)
- **[@MatheusCampagnolo](https://github.com/MatheusCampagnolo)** for `electron-development` (PR #282)

## [7.6.0] - 2026-03-12 - "Maintenance Sweep"

> **Merged community PRs, documented Windows truncation recovery, and hardened Metasploit setup guidance**

This release finishes a focused maintenance sweep across open pull requests and issues. It merges four community updates, ships the Jetski/Gemini overflow and path-safety documentation from the context overflow fix, adds a Windows recovery guide for truncation crash loops, and removes the non-deterministic Metasploit installer flow from the security skill.

## New Skills

- **acceptance-orchestrator** — acceptance-driven execution orchestration (PR #277)
- **closed-loop-delivery** — delivery workflow with feedback loops (PR #277)
- **create-issue-gate** — issue creation quality gate (PR #277)
- **interview-coach** — interview preparation and coaching (PR #272)

## Improvements

- **PR maintenance**: Merged PRs #277, #272, #275, #278, and #271 using GitHub squash merge so all contributors receive merge credit.
- **Jetski/Gemini loader docs**: Documented `overflowBehavior` handling and `skillsRoot`-confined path validation in the reference loader and integration guide (PR #271).
- **Windows recovery docs**: Added `docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md` and linked it from the main user docs for truncation/context crash loops on Windows.
- **Metasploit safety**: Replaced the remote installer pattern in `skills/metasploit-framework/SKILL.md` with an explicit "Metasploit must already be installed" prerequisite, and marked the skill as `risk: offensive` with the required warning.
- **Repo sync**: Refreshed README metadata, generated registry files, and contributor acknowledgements before release.
