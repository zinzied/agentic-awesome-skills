# AAS Core — Agentic Awesome Skills

> **Local, agent-owned skill stacks for coding agents—from complete catalog access to a reproducible, reviewable plan.**

**Current release: V15.12.0.** This release includes AAS Core for complete local catalog search, agent-owned selection, manifest validation, planning, and diagnosis. Apply and recovery remain experimental and outside the supported preview path.

Codex or Claude inspects your project and chooses exact skills from the complete local AAS catalog. AAS Core does not rank or recommend them: its read-only `compose_stack` tool validates the agent-owned selection in memory, and a client or the `aas` CLI can persist it as `aas-stack.json` and produce an immutable plan before any target change.

**[Read the AAS Core preview guide →](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v15.12.0/docs/users/aas-core.md)**

```text
Project
  -> inspected by Codex or Claude (not by AAS)
  -> agent searches and reads the complete local catalog
  -> AAS MCP (local stdio, read-only)
  -> Codex or Claude chooses exact skill IDs
  -> compose_stack validates the selection in memory (read-only)
  -> client or AAS CLI persists aas-stack.json and optional evidence
  -> AAS CLI validate + immutable plan preview
  -> human review (optionally in Workbench)
```

The reusable `SKILL.md` playbooks, specialized plugins, bundles, workflows, and direct installers remain important. They are the content, curation, distribution, and compatibility layers around AAS Core—not competing primary products.

This is an independent community project. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by, or authorized by Google. Google, Antigravity, Gemini, and related product names are referenced only to describe compatibility and install targets. The GitHub repository is canonical; the hosted catalog and browser-local Workbench are companion discovery and review surfaces, not a hosted control plane.

## AAS Core: Agent-First Preview

> **The agent composes. You control. AAS keeps the stack reproducible.**

AAS Core gives the repository one product model:

- **Let the agent choose.** The local MCP preserves `search_skills`, `get_skill`, `compose_stack`, `inspect_stack`, and `diff_stack`, and adds read-only `export_selection_evidence` and `inspect_selection_evidence`; Core does not rank, recommend, exclude, or hide skills.
- **Guide capability coverage.** MCP session instructions require the agent to evaluate the full project surface—from architecture, domain behavior, data and integrations through testing, security, UX, deployment, and maintenance—then search each applicable capability, compare multiple candidates, cover it with a non-redundant skill or report a catalog gap, and avoid stopping at a minimal shortlist. Core records and validates the resulting selection, but it does not certify semantic completeness.
- **Keep the chosen stack and evidence reviewable.** A client or the CLI can persist `aas-stack.json` and the separate `aas-selection-evidence.json` sidecar in an `artifact-dir`; the manifest preserves exact agent-selected IDs, while evidence records factual process trace and the agent-declared capability ledger.
- **Validate and preview through the CLI.** `aas stack validate` checks the proposal, while `aas stack plan` produces an immutable, per-target plan without applying it.
- **Review in Workbench.** The hosted Workbench imports and reviews stack/plan JSON in browser memory; it does not access your filesystem or install anything.
- **Retain every useful distribution path.** Direct installs, plugins, bundles, workflows, and the full catalog remain available as payload and compatibility surfaces.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Structural and identity validity does not certify semantic fit, compatibility, setup correctness, operational safety, or safety to apply.

| Surface | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| Published package | Current npm release; AAS Core status is `agent-first-preview` |
| Catalog search and inspection | Supported preview; local and read-only |
| Agent-owned composition | Supported preview; Core validates IDs and structure, not semantic suitability; manifests have a technical maximum of 128 skills |
| Stack validation and plan preview | Supported preview; no target skill changes |
| Workbench | Browser-local review of stack and plan artifacts |
| Selection evidence | Exported and inspected through MCP/CLI contracts; not yet reviewed in Workbench |
| Apply and recovery | Experimental, explicit opt-in, outside the supported safety claim |
| Semantic suitability certification | Not provided |

Read the [AAS Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v15.12.0/docs/users/aas-core.md) for the exact trust boundaries, current preview status, Codex/Claude setup model, and CLI lifecycle.

## Why This Repo

- **Agent-first, locally controlled**: Codex or Claude inspects the project and chooses from the complete local catalog without uploading your repository to AAS.
- **Complete and inspectable**: every catalog skill is searchable, readable, and available for agent selection; Core does not certify suitability, compatibility, or operational safety, and metadata is informational rather than an eligibility gate.
- **Approval before writes**: the durable artifacts are an approved stack and immutable plan, not an opaque one-shot install.
- **Installable, not just inspirational**: use the compatible legacy installer or plugin distributions when direct delivery is the right path.
- **Built for major agent workflows**: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Autohand Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Kiro, OpenCode, Copilot, and more.
- **Broad coverage with real utility**: 2,007+ skills across development, testing, security, infrastructure, product, and marketing.
- **Inspect before installing**: the hosted [Skill Workbench](https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/workbench) reviews agent-produced stack manifests and immutable plans without browser-side installation.
- **Focused delivery remains available**: specialized plugins package proven sets for web, security, data, docs, DevOps, QA, OSS, or agent/MCP workflows.
- **Useful whether you want breadth or curation**: install the full catalog, choose a specialized plugin, start with bundles, or compare alternatives before installing.

### Why not just search the skills directory?

Direct file search can find candidate prose, but it leaves the result in the conversation. AAS Core adds verified catalog identity, explicit target binding, durable desired state, optional selection evidence, deterministic validation, immutable planning, and dedicated review surfaces. Its value is not choosing better than the coding agent; it is turning the agent's choice into reproducible, inspectable state.

## Installation

For Codex and Claude, start with the [AAS Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v15.12.0/docs/users/aas-core.md): configure the local MCP, ask the agent to inspect the project and choose exact IDs from the full catalog, review the proposed `aas-stack.json`, then run CLI validation and planning. The MCP and validation are read-only. Planning writes only the requested plan artifact; it does not materialize skill payloads or AAS managed state in the target.

Use direct installation when your host does not yet have a native AAS Core adapter, when you already know the exact skill IDs, or when you deliberately prefer manual selection:

- **Specialized plugins** when the job has a clear domain.
- **Full library install** when you want every skill available in a local skills directory.
- **Bundles and workflows** when you want role-based recommendations or ordered execution playbooks.

### Direct skill install

```bash
# Antigravity: preview an exact, agent-selected set before writing.
npx agentic-awesome-skills --antigravity --skills brainstorming,systematic-debugging --dry-run

# Antigravity CLI slash commands (agy): ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
npx agentic-awesome-skills --agy
```

The npm installer uses a shallow, release-pinned clone by default so first-run installs stay lighter than a full repository history checkout while matching the published npm package version. Use `--tag main` only when you intentionally want the current repository tip.

Antigravity watches `~/.agents/skills` and may load enough installed instructions
to exhaust its context, slow startup, trigger truncation errors, or enter a crash
loop. For that target, the installer stops before cloning or writing unless you
provide `--skills`, a metadata filter, or the explicit `--all` override. The bare
`npx agentic-awesome-skills` command uses the same protected Antigravity target.

The recommended flow is to ask Codex or Claude with the read-only AAS Core MCP
configured to inspect the project, search the complete catalog, and choose exact
skill IDs. AAS MCP selects and validates IDs but does not install them; the agent
or user then previews the direct installation with the command above and repeats
it without `--dry-run` after review.

Other direct-install targets retain the legacy-compatible full-catalog behavior
when no selectors are supplied. The CLI prints the catalog's risk summary first:
a full install includes `critical` and authorized-use-only `offensive`
instructions. Installation copies files; it does not execute their commands,
but an agent may act on an installed skill later. Prefer an exact reviewed set:

```bash
npx agentic-awesome-skills audit --skills brainstorming,backend-dev-guidelines
npx agentic-awesome-skills --skills brainstorming,backend-dev-guidelines --dry-run
```

If you deliberately accept the context and crash-loop risk, the complete
Antigravity catalog remains available through explicit consent:

```bash
npx agentic-awesome-skills --antigravity --all
```

The audit reads the selected skill directories without executing them and
reports command, network, credential, filesystem, privileged, destructive,
symlink, and binary signals. It is a review aid, not a safety certificate. See
[Security, trust, and antivirus alerts](docs/users/security-and-antivirus.md).

### Focused single-skill install with GitHub CLI (preview)

GitHub CLI can preview and install one exact skill for Copilot and other supported hosts. Use an exact `SKILL.md` path in this large, mirrored repository so the selected source is unambiguous and discovery stays fast:

```bash
gh skill preview sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md
gh skill install sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md \
  --agent github-copilot --scope user --pin v14.2.0
```

`gh skill` support is currently a GitHub CLI preview and may change. Install a focused skill or plugin surface for the job; do not use `--all` unless you intentionally want every discovered canonical and mirrored skill.

### Verify the install

```bash
test -d ~/.agents/skills && echo "Skills installed in ~/.agents/skills"
```

### Run your first skill

```text
Use @brainstorming to plan a SaaS MVP.
```

### Prefer plugins for Claude Code, Codex, or another compatible client?

- Use a specialized plugin when you want a focused marketplace-style distribution.
- Use the full-library plugin only when you want the widest plugin-safe catalog.
- Read [Plugins for compatible agent clients](docs/users/plugins.md) for host-specific installs, portable Agent Plugins bundles, and direct skills installs.

## Recommended Specialized Plugins

Do not install everything first if you already know the work. Start with the focused plugin for your job, then add more only when the task expands.

All specialized plugins are generated as Claude Code and Codex plugin bundles. Bundles with flat, cross-host-safe skill layouts also receive a standard Agent Plugins 1.0 root manifest. For Antigravity, use the same `SKILL.md` content through the installer or supported skills paths.

## Quick FAQ

### What is Agentic Awesome Skills?

**Agentic Awesome Skills** is the repository behind AAS Core, a local agent-first control plane for recording and validating agent-chosen skill stacks. The read-only AAS MCP gives Codex and Claude complete catalog search and skill inspection; the stack CLI and Workbench make the chosen state reproducible and reviewable. Direct installers, specialized plugins, bundles, and workflows remain supported distribution and discovery surfaces.

### Is AAS Core fully certified?

The supported path covers complete local catalog search and inspection, agent-owned selection, stack composition and validation, immutable planning, and diagnosis. Transactional apply/recovery safety remains outside the supported claim; apply and recovery are explicitly experimental and disabled without additional opt-in flags.

### How do I install it?

For AAS Core, follow the [preview guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v15.12.0/docs/users/aas-core.md) and use only a package release whose notes explicitly state that it includes Core. Release 14.6.0 predates Core; Core-capable releases begin with the 15.x line.

For direct skill distribution, use a tool-specific flag such as `--codex`,
`--cursor`, `--gemini`, or `--claude` to place skills in the directory your
assistant watches. The default target is Antigravity; it requires `--skills`, a
metadata filter, or explicit `--all` consent before cloning or writing because a
full watched catalog can exhaust context or trigger a crash loop.

For Autohand Code, use the installer with a custom path:

```bash
npx agentic-awesome-skills --path ~/.autohand/skills
npx agentic-awesome-skills --path .autohand/skills
```

### What are AAS specialized plugins?

AAS specialized plugins are focused, domain-specific distributions of the skill library. They package the most relevant skills for web apps, security, data analytics, documents, DevOps, QA, OSS maintenance, and agent or MCP work so users can start with the right surface instead of activating the entire catalog.

### Should I use the full library or a plugin?

Use the full library if you want the biggest catalog and direct filesystem control. Use a specialized plugin when you want a smaller, marketplace-style distribution for a specific workflow in Claude Code or Codex. For Antigravity, install the matching skills into the supported skills path. The complete explanation lives in [Plugins for Claude Code and Codex](docs/users/plugins.md).

### How are plugins, bundles, and workflows different?

Plugins are installable packaging surfaces, bundles are curated skill recommendations, and workflows are ordered execution playbooks. Start with a plugin when the domain is clear, use bundles to compare adjacent skills, and use workflows when the important part is sequencing planning, coding, testing, auditing, or release work.

### Where do I browse plugins, bundles, workflows, and the full catalog?

Start with [Specialized Plugins](#recommended-specialized-plugins) when you want an installable domain pack. Use [Bundles](docs/users/bundles.md) for role-based recommendations, [Workflows](docs/users/workflows.md) for ordered execution playbooks, [CATALOG.md](CATALOG.md) for the full registry, and the hosted [GitHub Pages catalog](https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/) for searchable browsing.


## Bundles & Workflows

Core, plugins, bundles, and workflows answer different questions. Codex or Claude selects skills; AAS Core records and validates that selection; plugins package a focused delivery surface; bundles are curated starting points; workflows are ordered playbooks for getting a result.

| Surface | Answers | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AAS Core | How do I search the full catalog and preserve the agent's chosen stack? | Agent-owned selection, a pinned `aas-stack.json`, validation, and immutable plan preview. |
| Specialized plugin | What should I install or activate for this domain? | Focused Claude Code/Codex plugin packaging and Antigravity-compatible skill selection. |
| Bundle | Which skills naturally belong together? | Role-based discovery after a full-library install or when building a custom subset. |
| Workflow | What order should the agent run skills in? | Planning, shipping, auditing, testing, or incident-style execution. |

Use a specialized plugin first when your domain is clear. Use bundles to explore adjacent skills or assemble a custom install. Use workflows when the hard part is sequencing the work.

### Start with bundles

Bundles are curated groups of recommended skills for a role or goal such as `Web Wizard`, `Security Engineer`, or `OSS Maintainer`.

- Bundles are recommendations, not separate installs.
- Install the closest specialized plugin when one matches your work, or install the repository once and use [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md) to pick a starting set.
- Good starter combinations:
  - SaaS MVP: `Essentials` + `Full-Stack Developer` + `QA & Testing`
  - Production hardening: `Security Developer` + `DevOps & Cloud` + `Observability & Monitoring`
  - OSS shipping: `Essentials` + `OSS Maintainer`

### Use workflows for outcome-driven execution

- Read [docs/users/workflows.md](docs/users/workflows.md) for human-readable playbooks.
- Use [data/workflows.json](data/workflows.json) for machine-readable workflow metadata.
- Initial workflows include shipping a SaaS MVP, security audits, AI agent systems, QA/browser automation, and DDD-oriented design work.

### Need fewer active skills at runtime?

If Antigravity starts hitting context limits with too many active skills, the activation guidance in [docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md) can materialize only the bundles or skill ids you want in the live Antigravity directory.

If you use OpenCode or another `.agents/skills` host, prefer a reduced install up front instead of copying the full library into a context-sensitive runtime. The installer now supports `--risk`, `--category`, and `--tags` so you can keep the installed set narrow.

For a reproducible exact set, pin the package and catalog release and preview the full per-target plan before writing:

```bash
npx agentic-awesome-skills@14.3.0 --codex --release 14.3.0 --skills frontend-design,game-development/2d-games --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` only after reviewing the install, update, and removal plan. Unknown or ambiguous skill identifiers fail closed, and metadata filters combine with `--skills` using AND.

The hosted [Skill Workbench](https://sickn33.github.io/agentic-awesome-skills/workbench) imports and reviews AAS Core stack manifests and immutable plans in browser memory. It does not access the filesystem, generate an approved plan, or install skills.

## Troubleshooting

Keep the root README short; use the dedicated docs for recovery and platform-specific guidance.

- If you are confused after installation, start with the [Usage Guide](docs/users/usage.md).
- For Core setup, trust boundaries, stack manifests, and preview status, use the [AAS Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v15.12.0/docs/users/aas-core.md).

- For Linux/macOS overload or selective activation, use [docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md).
- For OpenCode or other `.agents/skills` installs, prefer a reduced install such as `npx agentic-awesome-skills --path .agents/skills --category development,backend --risk safe,none`.
- For plugin install details, host compatibility, and marketplace-safe distribution, use [docs/users/plugins.md](docs/users/plugins.md).
- For contributor expectations and guardrails, use [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Stable Skills Manifest v1

This is the stable **direct-host discovery manifest** for integrations that load individual `SKILL.md` files. It is not `aas-stack.json`, the verified AAS Core catalog, or the Core composition contract. Core users should start with the [AAS Core guide](https://github.com/sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills/blob/v15.12.0/docs/users/aas-core.md); custom host integrations can continue using the manifest below.

Host integrations should use:

- [`skills_index.json`](./skills_index.json) as the **canonical array-format manifest**.
- [`schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json`](./schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json) for the JSON shape.
- [`data/skills_index.json`](./data/skills_index.json) as the compatibility mirror.

This keeps discovery stable (`id`, `path`, metadata) while ensuring hosts only load `SKILL.md` for requested `@skill-id` values.
